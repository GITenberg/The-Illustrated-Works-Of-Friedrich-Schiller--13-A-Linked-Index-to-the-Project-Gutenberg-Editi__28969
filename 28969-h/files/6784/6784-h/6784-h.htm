<pre xml:space="preserve">
   MILLER&mdash;MRS. MILLER.
</pre>
    <p>
      MILLER (walking quickly up and down the room). Once for all! The affair is
      becoming serious. My daughter and the baron will soon be the town-talk&mdash;my
      house lose its character&mdash;the president will get wind of it, and&mdash;the
      short and long of the matter is, I'll show the younker the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. You did not entice him to your house&mdash;did not thrust your
      daughter upon him!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Didn't entice him to my house&mdash;didn't thrust the girl upon
      him! Who'll believe me? I was master of my own house. I ought to have
      taken more care of my daughter. I should have bundled the major out at
      once, or have gone straight to his excellency, his papa, and disclosed
      all. The young baron will get off merely with a snubbing, I know that well
      enough, and all the blame will fall upon the fiddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER (sipping her coffee). Pooh! nonsense! How can it fall upon you?
      What have people to do with you? You follow your profession, and pick up
      pupils wherever you can find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. All very fine, but please to tell me what will be the upshot of
      the whole affair? He can't marry the girl&mdash;marriage is out of the
      question, and to make her his&mdash;God help us! "Good-by t'ye!" No, no&mdash;when
      such a sprig of nobility has been nibbling here and there and everywhere,
      and has glutted himself with the devil knows what all, of course it will
      be a relish to my young gentleman to get a mouthful of sweet water. Take
      heed! Take heed! If you were dotted with eyes, and could place a sentinel
      for every hair of your head, he'll bamboozle her under your very nose; add
      one to her reckoning, take himself off, and the girl's ruined for life,
      left in the lurch, or, having once tasted the trade, will carry it on.
      (Striking his forehead.) Oh, horrible thought!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. God in his mercy protect us!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. We shall want his protection. You may well say that. What other
      object can such a scapegrace have? The girl is handsome&mdash;well made&mdash;can
      show a pretty foot. How the upper story is furnished matters little.
      That's blinked in you women if nature has not played the niggard in other
      respects. Let this harum-scarum but turn over this chapter&mdash;ho! ho!
      his eyes will glisten like Rodney's when he got scent of a French frigate;
      then up with all sail and at her, and I don't blame him for it&mdash;
      flesh is flesh. I know that very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. You should only read the beautiful billy-doux which the baron
      writes to your daughter. Gracious me! Why it's as clear as the sun at
      noonday that he loves her purely for her virtuous soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. That's the right strain! We beat the sack, but mean the ass's
      back. He who wishes to pay his respects to the flesh needs only a kind
      heart for a go-between. What did I myself? When we've once so far cleared
      the ground that the affections cry ready! slap! the bodies follow their
      example, the appetites are obedient, and the silver moon kindly plays the
      pimp.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. And then only think of the beautiful books that the major has
      sent us. Your daughter always prays out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (whistles). Prays! You've hit the mark. The plain, simple food of
      nature is much too raw and indigestible for this maccaroni gentleman's
      stomach. It must be cooked for him artificially in the infernal
      pestilential pitcher of your novel-writers. Into the fire with the
      rubbish! I shall have the girl taking up with&mdash;God knows what all&mdash;about
      heavenly fooleries that will get into her blood, like Spanish flies, and
      scatter to the winds the handful of Christianity that cost her father so
      much trouble to keep together. Into the fire with them I say! The girl
      will take the devil's own nonsense into her head; amidst the dreams of her
      fool's paradise she'll not know her own home, but forget and feel ashamed
      of her father, the music-master; and, lastly, I shall lose a worthy,
      honest son-in-law who might have nestled himself so snugly into my
      connections. No! damn it! (Jumps up in a passion.) I'll break the neck of
      it at once, and the major&mdash;yes, yes, the major! shall be shown where
      the carpenter made the door. (Going.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Be civil, Miller! How many a bright shilling have his presents&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (comes back, and goes up to her). The blood money of my daughter?
      To Beelzebub with thee, thou infamous bawd! Sooner will I vagabondize with
      my violin and fiddle for a bit of bread&mdash;sooner will I break to
      pieces my instrument and carry dung on the sounding-board than taste a
      mouthful earned by my only child at the price of her soul and future
      happiness. Give up your cursed coffee and snuff-taking, and there will be
      no need to carry your daughter's face to market. I have always had my
      bellyful and a good shirt to my back before this confounded scamp put his
      nose into my crib.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Now don't be so ready to pitch the house out of window. How
      you flare up all of a sudden. I only meant to say that we shouldn't offend
      the major, because he is the son of the president.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. There lies the root of the mischief. For that reason&mdash;for
      that very reason the thing must be put a stop to this very day! The
      president, if he is a just and upright father, will give me his thanks.
      You must brush up my red plush, and I will go straight to his excellency.
      I shall say to him,&mdash;"Your excellency's son has an eye to my
      daughter; my daughter is not good enough to be your excellency's son's
      wife, but too good to be your excellency's son's strumpet, and there's an
      end of the matter. My name is Miller."

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Enter SECRETARY WORM.
</pre>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Ah! Good morning, Mr. Seckertary! Have we indeed the pleasure
      of seeing you again?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. All on my side&mdash;on my side, cousin Miller! Where a high-born
      cavalier's visits are received mine can be of no account whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. How can you think so, Mr. Seckertary? His lordship the baron,
      Major Ferdinand, certainly does us the honor to look in now and then; but,
      for all that, we don't undervalue others.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (vexed). A chair, wife, for the gentleman! Be seated, kinsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (lays aside hat and stick, and seats himself). Well, well&mdash;and
      how then is my future&mdash;or past&mdash;bride? I hope she'll not be&mdash;may
      I not have the honor of seeing&mdash;Miss Louisa?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Thanks for inquiries, Mr. Seckertary, but my daughter is not
      at all proud.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (angry, jogs her with his elbow). Woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Sorry she can't have that honor, Mr. Seckertary. My daughter
      is now at mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. I am glad to hear it,&mdash;glad to hear it. I shall have in her a
      pious, Christian wife!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER (smiling in a stupidly affected manner). Yes&mdash;but, Mr.
      Seckertary&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (greatly incensed, pulls her ears). Woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. If our family can serve you in any other way&mdash;with the
      greatest pleasure, Mr. Seckertary&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (frowning angrily). In any other way? Much obliged! much obliged!&mdash;hm!
      hm! hm!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. But, as you yourself must see, Mr. Seckertary&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (in a rage, shaking his fist at her). Woman!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Good is good, and better is better, and one does not like to
      stand between fortune and one's only child (with vulgar pride). You
      understand me, Mr. Seckertary?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Understand. Not exac&mdash;-. Oh, yes. But what do you really mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Why&mdash;why&mdash;I only think&mdash;I mean&mdash;(coughs).
      Since then Providence has determined to make a great lady of my daughter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (jumping from his chair). What's that you say? what?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Keep your seat, keep your seat, Mr. Secretary! The woman's an
      out-and-out fool! Where's the great lady to come from? How you show your
      donkey's ears by talking such stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Scold as long as you will. I know what I know, and what the
      major said he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (snatches up his fiddle in anger). Will you hold your tongue? Shall
      I throw my fiddle at your head? What can you know? What can he have said?
      Take no notice of her clack, kinsman! Away with you to your kitchen!
      You'll not think me first cousin of a fool, and that I'm looking out so
      high for the girl? You'll not think that of me, Mr. Secretary?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Nor have I deserved it of you, Mr. Miller! You have always shown
      yourself a man of your word, and my contract to your daughter was as good
      as signed. I hold an office that will maintain a thrifty manager; the
      president befriends me; the door to advancement is open to me whenever I
      may choose to take advantage of it. You see that my intentions towards
      Miss Louisa are serious; if you have been won over by a fop of rank&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Mr. Seckertary! more respect, I beg&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Hold your tongue, I say. Never mind her, kinsman. Things remain as
      they were. The answer I gave you last harvest, I repeat to-day. I'll not
      force my daughter. If you suit her, well and good; then it's for her to
      see that she can be happy with you. If she shakes her head&mdash;still
      better&mdash;be it so, I should say&mdash;then you must be content to
      pocket the refusal, and part in good fellowship over a bottle with her
      father. 'Tis the girl who is to live with you&mdash;not I. Why should I,
      out of sheer caprice, fasten a husband upon the girl for whom she has no
      inclination? That the evil one may haunt me down like a wild beast in my
      old age&mdash;that in every drop I drink&mdash;in every bit of bread I
      bite, I might swallow the bitter reproach: Thou art the villain who
      destroyed his child's happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. The short and the long of it is&mdash;I refuse my consent
      downright; my daughter's intended for a lofty station, and I'll go to law
      if my husband is going to be talked over.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Shall I break every bone in your body, you millclack?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (to MILLER). Paternal advice goes a great way with the daughter, and
      I hope you know me, Mr. Miller?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Plague take you! 'Tis the girl must know you. What an old
      crabstick like me can see in you is just the very last thing that a dainty
      young girl wants. I'll tell you to a hair if you're the man for an
      orchestra&mdash;but a woman's heart is far too deep for a music-master.
      And then, to be frank with you&mdash;you know that I'm a blunt,
      straightforward fellow&mdash;you'll not give thank'ye for my advice. I'll
      persuade my daughter to no one&mdash;but from you Mr. Sec&mdash;I would
      dissuade her! A lover who calls upon the father for help&mdash;with
      permission&mdash;is not worth a pinch of snuff. If he has anything in him,
      he'll be ashamed to take that old-fashioned way of making his deserts
      known to his sweetheart. If he hasn't the courage, why he's a milksop, and
      no Louisas were born for the like of him. No! he must carry on his
      commerce with the daughter behind the father's back. He must manage so to
      win her heart, that she would rather wish both father and mother at Old
      Harry than give him up&mdash;or that she come herself, fall at her
      father's feet, and implore either for death on the rack, or the only one
      of her heart. That's the fellow for me! that I call love! and he who can't
      bring matters to that pitch with a petticoat may&mdash;stick the goose
      feather in his cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (seizes hat and stick and hurries out of the room). Much obliged, Mr.
      Miller!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (going after him slowly). For what? for what? You haven't taken
      anything, Mr. Secretary! (Comes back.) He won't hear, and off he's gone.
      The very sight of that quill-driver is like poison and brimstone to me. An
      ugly, contraband knave, smuggled into the world by some lewd prank of the
      devil&mdash;with his malicious little pig's eyes, foxy hair, and
      nut-cracker chin, just as if Nature, enraged at such a bungled piece of
      goods, had seized the ugly monster by it, and flung him aside. No! rather
      than throw away my daughter on a vagabond like him, she may&mdash;God
      forgive me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. The wretch!&mdash;but you'll be made to keep a clean tongue in
      your head!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Ay, and you too, with your pestilential baron&mdash;you, too, must
      put my bristles up. You're never more stupid than when you have the most
      occasion to show a little sense. What's the meaning of all that trash
      about your daughter being a great lady? If it's to be cried out about the
      town to-morrow, you need only let that fellow get scent of it. He is one
      of your worthies who go sniffing about into people's houses, dispute upon
      everything, and, if a slip of the tongue happen to you, skurry with it
      straight to the prince, mistress, and minister, and then there's the devil
      to pay.

   Enter LOUISA with a book in her hand.
</pre>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Good morning, dear father!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (affectionately). Bless thee, my Louisa! I rejoice to see thy
      thoughts are turned so diligently to thy Creator. Continue so, and his arm
      will support thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh! I am a great sinner, father! Was he not here, mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Who, my child?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Ah! I forgot that there are others in the world besides him&mdash;my
      head wanders so. Was he not here? Ferdinand?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (with melancholy, serious voice). I thought my Louisa had forgotten
      that name in her devotions?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (after looking at him steadfastly for some time). I understand you,
      father. I feel the knife which stabs my conscience; but it comes too late.
      I can no longer pray, father. Heaven and Ferdinand divide my bleeding
      soul, and I fear&mdash;I fear&mdash;(after a pause). Yet no, no, good
      father. The painter is best praised when we forget him in the
      contemplation of his picture. When in the contemplation of his
      masterpiece, my delight makes me forget the Creator,&mdash;is not that,
      father, the true praise of God?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (throws himself in displeasure on a chair). There we have it! Those
      are the fruits of your ungodly reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (uneasy, goes to the window). Where can he be now? Ah! the
      high-born ladies who see him&mdash;listen to him&mdash;&mdash;I am a poor
      forgotten maiden. (Startles at that word, and rushes to her father.) But
      no, no! forgive me. I do not repine at my lot. I ask but little&mdash;to
      think on him&mdash;that can harm no one. Ah! that I might breathe out this
      little spark of life in one soft fondling zephyr to cool his check! That
      this fragile floweret, youth, were a violet, on which he might tread, and
      I die modestly beneath his feet! I ask no more, father! Can the proud,
      majestic day-star punish the gnat for basking in its rays?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (deeply affected, leans on the arm of his chair, and covers his
      face). My child, my child, with joy would I sacrifice the remnant of my
      days hadst thou never seen the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (terrified.) How; how? What did you say? No, no! that could not be
      your meaning, good father. You know not that Ferdinand is mine! You know
      not that God created him for me, and for my delight alone! (After a pause
      of recollection.) The first moment that I beheld him&mdash;and the blood
      rushed into my glowing cheeks&mdash;every pulse beat with joy; every throb
      told me, every breath whispered, "'Tis he!" And my heart, recognizing the
      long-desired one, repeated "'Tis he!" And the whole world was as one
      melodious echo of my delight! Then&mdash;oh! then was the first dawning of
      my soul! A thousand new sentiments arose in my bosom, as flowers arise
      from the earth when spring approaches. I forgot there was a world, yet
      never had I felt that world so dear to me! I forgot there was a God, yet
      never had I so loved him!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (runs to her and clasps her to his bosom). Louisa! my beloved, my
      admirable child! Do what thou wilt. Take all&mdash;all&mdash;my life&mdash;the
      baron&mdash; God is my witness&mdash;him I can never give thee! [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Nor would I have him now, father! Time on earth is but a stinted
      dewdrop in the ocean of eternity. 'Twill swiftly glide in one delicious
      dream of Ferdinand. I renounce him for this life! But then, mother&mdash;then
      when the bounds of separation are removed&mdash;when the hated
      distinctions of rank no longer part us&mdash;when men will be only men&mdash;I
      shall bring nothing with me save my innocence! Yet often has my father
      told me that at the Almighty's coming riches and titles will be worthless;
      and that hearts alone will be beyond all price. Oh! then shall I be rich!
      There, tears will be reckoned for triumphs, and purity of soul be
      preferred to an illustrious ancestry. Then, then, mother, shall I be
      noble! In what will he then be superior to the girl of his heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER (starts from her seat). Louisa! the baron! He is jumping over
      the fence! Where shall I hide myself?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (begins to tremble). Oh! do not leave me, mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS MILLER. Mercy! What a figure I am. I am quite ashamed! I cannot let
      his lordship see me in this state!

      SCENE IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LOUISA&mdash;FERDINAND. (He flies towards her&mdash;she falls back into her
   chair, pale and trembling. He remains standing before her&mdash;they
   look at each other for some moments in silence. A pause.)
</pre>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. So pale, Louisa?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (rising, and embracing him). It is nothing&mdash;nothing now that
      you are here&mdash;it is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (takes her hand and raises it to his lips). And does my Louisa
      still love me? My heart is yesterday's; is thine the same? I flew hither
      to see if thou wert happy, that I might return and be so too. But I find
      thee whelmed in sorrow!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Not so, my beloved, not so!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Confess, Louisa! you are not happy. I see through your soul as
      clearly as through the transparent lustre of this brilliant. No spot can
      harbor here unmarked by me&mdash;no thought can cloud your brow that does
      not reach your lover's heart. Whence comes this grief? Tell me, I beseech
      you! Ah! could I feel assured this mirror still remained unsullied,
      there'd seem to me no cloud in all the universe! Tell me, dear Louisa,
      what afflicts you?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (looking at him with anxiety for a few moments). Ferdinand! couldst
      thou but know how such discourse exalts the tradesman's daughter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (surprised). What say'st thou? Tell me, girl! how camest thou by
      that thought? Thou art my Louisa! who told thee thou couldst be aught
      else? See, false one, see, for what coldness I must chide thee! Were
      indeed thy whole soul absorbed by love for me, never hadst thou found time
      to draw comparisons! When I am with thee, my prudence is lost in one look
      from thine eyes: when I am absent in a dream of thee! But thou &mdash;thou
      canst harbor prudence in the sane breast with love! Fie on thee! Every
      moment bestowed on this sorrow was a robbery from affection and from me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (pressing his hand and shaking her head with a melancholy air).
      Ferdinand, you would lull my apprehensions to sleep; you would divert my
      eyes from the precipice into which I am falling. I can see the future! The
      voice of honor&mdash;your prospects, your father's anger&mdash;my
      nothingness. (Shuddering and suddenly drops his hands.) Ferdinand! a sword
      hangs over us! They would separate us!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (jumps up). Separate us! Whence these apprehensions, Louisa? Who
      can rend the bonds that bind two hearts, or separate the tones of one
      accord? True, I am a nobleman&mdash;but show me that my patent of nobility
      is older than the eternal laws of the universe&mdash;or my escutcheon more
      valid than the handwriting of heaven in my Louisa's eyes? "This woman is
      for this man?" I am son of the prime minister. For that very reason, what
      but love can soften the curses which my father's extortions from the
      country will entail upon me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh! how I fear that father!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I fear nothing&mdash;nothing but that your affection should
      know bounds. Let obstacles rise between us, huge as mountains, I will look
      upon them as a ladder by which to fly into the arms of my Louisa! The
      tempest of opposing fate shall but fan the flame of my affection dangers
      will only serve to make Louisa yet more charming. Then speak no more of
      terrors, my love! I myself&mdash;I will watch over thee carefully as the
      enchanter's dragon watches over buried gold. Trust thyself to me! thou
      shalt need no other angel. I will throw myself between thee and fate&mdash;
      for thee receive each wound. For thee will I catch each drop distilled
      from the cup of joy, and bring thee in the bowl of love. (Embracing
      affectionately.) This arm shall support my Louisa through life. Fairer
      than it dismissed thee, shall heaven receive thee back, and confess with
      delight that love alone can give perfection to the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (disengaging herself from him, greatly agitated). No more! I
      beseech thee, Ferdinand! no more! Couldst thou know. Oh! leave me, leave
      me! Little dost thou feel how these hopes rend my heart in pieces like
      fiends! (Going.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (detaining her). Stay, Louisa! stay! Why this agitation? Why
      those anxious looks?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I had forgotten these dreams, and was happy. Now&mdash;now&mdash;from
      this day is the tranquillity of my heart no more. Wild impetuous wishes
      will torment my bosom! Go! God forgive thee! Thou hast hurled a firebrand
      into my young peaceful heart which nothing can extinguish! (She breaks
      from him, and rushes from the apartment, followed by FERDINAND.)

      SCENE V.&mdash;A Chamber in the PRESIDENT.'S House.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   The PRESIDENT, with the grand order of the cross about his neck,
   and a star at his breast&mdash;SECRETARY WORM.
</pre>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. A serious attachment, say you? No, no, Worm; that I never can
      believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. If your excellency pleases, I will bring proofs of my assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. That he has a fancy for the wench&mdash;flatters her&mdash;and,
      if you will, pretends to love her&mdash;all this is very possible&mdash;nay&mdash;excusable
      &mdash;but&mdash;and the daughter of a musician, you say?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Of Miller, the music-master.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Handsome? But that, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (with warmth). A most captivating and lovely blondine, who, without
      saying too much, might figure advantageously beside the greatest beauties
      of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (laughs). It's very plain, Worm, that you have an eye upon the
      jade yourself&mdash;I see that. But listen, Worm. That my son has a
      passion for the fair sex gives me hope that he will find favor with the
      ladies. He may make his way at court. The girl is handsome, you say; I am
      glad to think my son has taste. Can he deceive the silly wench by holding
      out honorable intentions&mdash;still better; it will show that he is
      shrewd enough to play the hypocrite when it serves his purpose. He may
      become prime minister&mdash;if he accomplishes his purpose! Admirable!
      that will prove to me that fortune favors him. Should the farce end with a
      chubby grandchild&mdash;incomparable! I will drink an extra bottle of
      Malaga to the prospects of my pedigree, and cheerfully pay the wench's
      lying-in expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. All I wish is that your excellency may not have to drink that bottle
      to drown your sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (sternly). Worm! remember that what I once believe, I believe
      obstinately&mdash;that I am furious when angered. I am willing to pass
      over as a joke this attempt to stir my blood. That you are desirous of
      getting rid of your rival, I can very well comprehend, and that, because
      you might have some difficulty in supplanting the son, you endeavor to
      make a cat's-paw of the father, I can also understand&mdash;I am even
      delighted to find that you are master of such excellent qualifications in
      the way of roguery. Only, friend Worm, pray don't make me, too, the butt
      of your knavery. Understand me, have a care that your cunning trench not
      upon my plans!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Pardon me, your excellency! If even&mdash;as you suspect&mdash;jealousy
      is concerned, it is only with the eye, and not with the tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. It would be better to dispense with it altogether. What can it
      matter to you, simpleton, whether you get your coin fresh from the mint,
      or it comes through a banker? Console yourself with the example of our
      nobility. Whether known to the bridegroom or not, I can assure you that,
      amongst us of rank, scarcely a marriage takes place but what at least half
      a dozen of the guests&mdash;or the footmen&mdash;can state the geometrical
      area of the bridegroom's paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (bowing). My lord! Upon this head I confess myself a plebeian.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. And, besides, you may soon have the satisfaction of turning the
      laugh most handsomely against your rival. At this very moment it is under
      consideration in the cabinet, that, upon the arrival of the new duchess,
      Lady Milford shall apparently be discarded, and, to complete the
      deception, form an alliance. You know, Worm, how greatly my influence
      depends upon this lady&mdash;how my mightiest prospects hang upon the
      passions of the prince. The duke is now seeking a partner for Lady
      Milford. Some one else may step in&mdash;conclude the bargain for her
      ladyship, win the confidence of the prince, and make himself
      indispensable, to my cost. Now, to retain the prince in the meshes of my
      family, I have resolved that my Ferdinand shall marry Lady Milford. Is
      that clear to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Quite dazzling! Your excellency has at least convinced me that,
      compared with the president, the father is but a novice. Should the major
      prove as obedient a son as you show yourself a tender father, your demand
      may chance to be returned with a protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Fortunately I have never yet had to fear opposition to my will
      when once I have pronounced, "It shall be so!" But now, Worm, that brings
      us back to our former subject! I will propose Lady Milford to my son this
      very day. The face which he puts upon it shall either confirm your
      suspicions or entirely confute them.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Pardon me, my lord! The sullen face which he most assuredly will put
      upon it may be placed equally to the account of the bride you offer to him
      as of her from whom you wish to separate him. I would beg of you a more
      positive test! Propose to him some perfectly unexceptionable woman. Then,
      if he consents, let Secretary Worm break stones on the highway for the
      next three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (biting his lips). The devil!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Such is the case, you may rest assured! The mother&mdash;stupidity
      itself&mdash;has, in her simplicity, betrayed all to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (pacing the room, and trying to repress his rage). Good! this
      very morning, then!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Yet, let me entreat your excellency not to forget that the major&mdash;
      is my master's son&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. No harm shall come to him, Worm.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. And that my service in ridding you of an unwelcome daughter-in-law&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Should be rewarded by me helping you to a wife? That too, Worm!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (bowing with delight). Eternally your lordship's slave. (Going.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (threatening him). As to what I have confided to you, Worm! If
      you dare but to whisper a syllable&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (laughs). Then your excellency will no doubt expose my forgeries!

      MARSHAL. Just listen! Scarce had I quitted my carriage, when the horses
      became restive, and began to plunge and rear&mdash;only imagine!&mdash;splashed
      my breeches all over with mud! What was to be done? Fancy, my dear baron,
      just fancy yourself for a moment in my predicament! There I stood! the
      hour was late! a day's journey to return&mdash;yet to appear before his
      highness in this&mdash;good heavens! What did I bethink me of? I pretended
      to faint! They bundle me into my carriage! I drive home like mad&mdash;
      change my dress&mdash;hasten back&mdash;and only think!&mdash;in spite of
      all this I was the first person in the antechamber! What say you to that?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. A most admirable impromptu of mortal wit&mdash;but tell me,
      Kalb, did you speak to the duke?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (importantly). Full twenty minutes and a half.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Indeed? Then doubtless you have important news to impart to me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (seriously, after a pause of reflection). His highness wears a
      Merde d'Oye beaver to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. God bless me!&mdash;and yet, marshal, I have even greater news
      to tell you. Lady Milford will soon become my daughter-in-law. That, I
      think will be new to you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Is it possible! And is it already agreed upon?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. It is settled, marshal&mdash;and you would oblige me by
      forthwith waiting upon her ladyship, and preparing her to receive
      Ferdinand's visit. You have full liberty, also, to circulate the news of
      my son's approaching nuptials.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. My dear friend! With consummate pleasure! What can I desire more?
      I fly to the baroness this moment. Adieu! (Embracing him.) In less than
      three-quarters of an hour it shall be known throughout the town. [Skips
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (smiling contemptuously). How can people say that such creatures
      are of no use in the world? Now, then, Master Ferdinand must either
      consent or give the whole town the lie. (Rings&mdash;WORM enters.) Send my
      son hither. (WORM retires; the PRESIDENT walks up and down, full of
      thought.)

      SCENE VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   PRESIDENT&mdash;FERDINAND.
</pre>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. In obedience to your commands, sir&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Ay, if I desire the presence of my son, I must command it&mdash;
      Ferdinand, I have observed you for some time past, and find no longer that
      open vivacity of youth which once so delighted me. An unusual sorrow
      broods upon your features; you shun your father; you shun society. For
      shame, Ferdinand! At your age a thousand irregularities are easier
      forgiven than one instant of idle melancholy. Leave this to me, my son!
      Leave the care of your future happiness to my direction, and study only to
      co-operate with my designs&mdash;come, Ferdinand, embrace me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You are most gracious to-day, father!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. "To-day," you rogue? and your "to-day" with such a vinegar
      look? (Seriously.) Ferdinand! For whose sake have I trod that dangerous
      path which leads to the affections of the prince? For whose sake have I
      forever destroyed my peace with Heaven and my conscience? Hear me,
      Ferdinand&mdash;I am speaking to my son. For whom have I paved the way by
      the removal of my predecessor? a deed which the more deeply gores my
      inward feelings the more carefully I conceal the dagger from the world!
      Tell me, Ferdinand, for whose sake have I done all this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (recoiling with horror). Surely not for mine, father, not for
      mine? Surely not on me can fall the bloody reflection of this murder? By
      my Almighty Maker, it were better never to have been born than to be the
      pretext for such a crime!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. What sayest thou? How? But I will attribute these strange
      notions to thy romantic brain, Ferdinand; let me not lose my temper&mdash;
      ungrateful boy! Thus dost thou repay me for my sleepless nights? Thus for
      my restless anxiety to promote thy good? Thus for the never-dying scorpion
      of my conscience? Upon me must fall the burden of responsibility; upon me
      the curse, the thunderbolt of the Judge. Thou receivest thy fortune from
      another's hand&mdash;the crime is not attached to the inheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (extending his right hand towards heaven). Here I solemnly
      abjure an inheritance which must ever remind me of a parent's guilt!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Hear me, sirrah! and do not incense me! Were you left to your
      own direction you would crawl through life in the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Oh! better, father, far, far better, than to crawl about a
      throne!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (repressing his anger). So! Then compulsion must make you
      sensible of your good fortune! To that point, which, with the utmost
      striving a thousand others fail to reach, you have been exalted in your
      very sleep. At twelve you received a commission; at twenty a command. I
      have succeeded in obtaining for you the duke's patronage. He bids you lay
      aside your uniform, and share with me his favor and his confidence. He
      spoke of titles&mdash;embassies&mdash;of honors bestowed but upon few. A
      glorious prospect spreads itself before you! The direct path to the place
      next the throne lies open to you! Nay, to the throne itself, if the actual
      power of ruling is equivalent to the mere symbol. Does not that idea
      awaken your ambition?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. No! My ideas of greatness and happiness differ widely from
      yours. Your happiness is but seldom known, except by the misery of others.
      Envy, terror, hatred are the melancholy mirrors in which the smiles of
      princes are reflected. Tears, curses, and the wailings of despair, the
      horrid banquet that feasts your supposed elect of fortune; intoxicated
      with these they rush headlong into eternity, staggering to the throne of
      judgment. My ideas of happiness teach me to look for its fountain in
      myself! All my wishes lie centered in my heart!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Masterly! Inimitable! Admirable! The first schooling I have
      received these thirty years! Pity that the brain at fifty should be so
      dull at learning! But&mdash;that such talent may not rust, I will place
      one by your side on whom you can practise your harlequinade follies at
      pleasure. You will resolve&mdash;resolve this very day&mdash;to take a
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (starting back amazed). Father!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Answer me not. I have made proposals, in your name, to Lady
      Milford. You will instantly determine upon going to her, and declaring
      yourself her bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Lady Milford! father?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. I presume she is not unknown to you!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (passionately). To what brothel is she unknown through the
      dukedom? But pardon me, dearest father! It is ridiculous to imagine that
      your proposal can be serious. Would you call yourself father of that
      infamous son who married a licensed prostitute?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Nay, more. I would ask her hand myself, if she would take a man
      of fifty. Would not you call yourself that infamous father's son?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. No! as God lives! that would I not!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. An audacity, by my honor! which I pardon for its excessive
      singularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I entreat you, father, release me from a demand which would
      render it insupportable to call myself your son.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Are you distracted, boy? What reasonable man would not thirst
      after a distinction which makes him, as one of a trio, the equal and
      co-partner of his sovereign?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You are quite an enigma to me, father! "A distinction," do you
      call it? A distinction to share that with a prince, wherein he places
      himself on a level with the meanest of his subjects? (The PRESIDENT bursts
      into a loud laugh.) You may scoff&mdash;I must submit to it in a father.
      With what countenance should I support the gaze of the meanest laborer,
      who at least receives an undivided person as the portion of his bride?
      With what countenance should I present myself before the world? before the
      prince? nay, before the harlot herself, who seeks to wash out in my shame
      the brandmarks of her honor?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Where in the world couldst thou collect such notions, boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I implore you, father, by heaven and earth! By thus sacrificing
      your only son you can never become so happy as you will make him
      miserable! If my life can be a step to your advancement, dispose of it. My
      life you gave me; and I will never hesitate a moment to sacrifice it
      wholly to your welfare. But my honor, father! If you deprive me of this,
      the giving me life was a mere trick of wanton cruelty, and I must equally
      curse the parent and the pander.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (tapping him on the shoulder in a friendly manner). That's as it
      should be, my dear boy! Now I see that you are a brave and noble fellow,
      and worthy of the first woman in the dukedom. You shall have her. This
      very day you shall be affianced to the Countess of Ostheim.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in new disorder). Is this, then, destined to be the hour of my
      destruction?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (regarding him with an eye of suspicion). In this union, I
      imagine, you can have no objection on the score of honor?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. None, father, none whatever. Frederica of Ostheim would make
      any other the happiest of men. (Aside, in the greatest agitation.) His
      kindness rends in pieces that remnant of my heart which his cruelty left
      unwounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (his eye still fixed upon him). I expect your gratitude,
      Ferdinand!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (rushes towards him and kisses his hands). Father, your goodness
      awakens every spark of sentiment in my bosom. Father! receive my warmest
      thanks for your kind intentions. Your choice is unexceptionable! But I
      cannot&mdash;I dare not&mdash;pity me, father, I never can love the
      countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (draws back). Ha! ha! now I've caught you, young gentleman! The
      cunning fox has tumbled into the trap. Oh, you artful hypocrite! It was
      not then honor which made you refuse Lady Milford? It was not the woman,
      but the nuptials which alarmed you! (FERDINAND stands petrified for a
      moment; then recovers himself and prepares to quit the chamber hastily.)
      Whither now? Stay, sir. Is this the respect due to your father? (FERDINAND
      returns slowly.) Her ladyship expects you. The duke has my promise! Both
      court and city believe all is settled. If thou makest me appear a liar,
      boy! If, before the duke&mdash;the lady&mdash;the court and city&mdash;thou
      shouldst make me appear a liar!&mdash;tremble, boy!&mdash;or when I have
      gained information of certain circumstances&mdash;how now? Why does the
      color so suddenly forsake your cheeks?

      <br /> <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (pale and trembling). How? What? Nothing&mdash;it is nothing, my
      father!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (casting upon him a dreadful look). Should there be cause. If I
      should discover the source whence this obstinacy proceeds! Boy! boy! the
      very suspicion drives me distracted! Leave me this moment. 'Tis now the
      hour of parade. As soon as the word is given, go thou to her ladyship. At
      my nod a dukedom trembles; we shall see whether a disobedient son dare
      dispute my will! (Going, returns.) Remember, sir! fail not to wait on Lady
      Milford, or dread my anger!

      her&mdash;hold such a mirror before her eyes. Then, base woman, shouldst

      SCENE I.&mdash;A room in LADY MILFORD'S house. On the right of the stage
    </h2>
    <p>
      stands a sofa, on the left a pianoforte.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LADY MILFORD, in a loose but elegant negligee, is running her hand
   over the keys of the pianoforte as SOPHY advances from the window.
</pre>
    <p>
      SOPHY. The parade is over, and the officers are separating, but I see no
      signs of the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (rises and walks up and down the room in visible agitation).
      I know not what ails me to-day, Sophy! I never felt so before&mdash;you
      say you do not see him! It is evident enough that he is by no means
      impatient for this meeting&mdash;my heart feels oppressed as if by some
      heavy crime. Go! Sophy, order the most spirited horse in the stable to be
      saddled for me&mdash;I must away into the open air where I may look on the
      blue sky and hear the busy hum of man. I must dispel this gloominess by
      change and motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. If you feel out of spirits, my lady, why not invite company! Let
      the prince give an entertainment here, or have the ombre table brought to
      you. If the prince and all his court were at my beck and call I would let
      no whim or fancy trouble me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (throwing herself on the couch). Pray, spare me. I would
      gladly give a jewel in exchange for every hour's respite from the
      infliction of such company! I always have my rooms tapestried with these
      creatures! Narrow-minded, miserable beings, who are quite shocked if by
      chance a candid and heartfelt word should escape one's lips! and stand
      aghast as though they saw an apparition; slaves, moved by a single
      puppet-wire, which I can govern as easily as the threads of my embroidery!
      What can I have in common with such insipid wretches, whose souls, like
      their watches, are regulated by machinery? What pleasure can I have in the
      society of people whose answers to my questions I know beforehand? How can
      I hold communion with men who dare not venture on an opinion of their own
      lest it should differ from mine! Away with them&mdash;I care not to ride a
      horse that has not spirit enough to champ the bit! (Goes to the window.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. But surely, my lady, you except the prince, the handsomest, the
      wittiest, and the most gallant man in all his duchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (returning). Yes, in his duchy, that was well said&mdash;and
      it is only a royal duchy, Sophy, that could in the least excuse my
      weakness. You say the world envies me! Poor thing! It should rather pity
      me! Believe me, of all who drink of the streams of royal bounty there is
      none more miserable than the sovereign's favorite, for he who is great and
      mighty in the eyes of others comes to her but as the humble suppliant! It
      is true that by the talisman of his greatness he can realize every wish of
      my heart as readily as the magician calls forth the fairy palace from the
      depths of the earth! He can place the luxuries of both Indies upon my
      table, turn the barren wilderness to a paradise, can bid the broad rivers
      of his land play in triumphal arches over my path, or expend all the
      hard-earned gains of his subjects in a single feu-de-joie to my honor. But
      can he school his heart to respond to one great or ardent emotion? Can he
      extort one noble thought from his weak and indigent brain? Alas! my heart
      is thirsting amid all this ocean of splendor; what avail, then, a thousand
      virtuous sentiments when I am only permitted to indulge in the pleasures
      of the senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOFHY (regarding her with surprise). Dear lady, you amaze me! how long is
      it since I entered your service?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Do you ask because this is the first day on which you have
      learnt to know me? I have sold my honor to the prince, it is true, but my
      heart is still my own&mdash;a heart, dear Sophy, which even yet may be
      worth the acceptance of an honorable man&mdash;a heart over which the
      pestilential blast of courtly corruption has passed as the breath which
      for a moment dims the mirror's lustre. Believe me my spirit would long
      since have revolted against this miserable thraldom could my ambition have
      submitted to see another advanced to my place.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. And could a heart like yours so readily surrender itself to mere
      ambition?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (with energy). Has it not already been avenged? nay, is it
      not even at this very moment making me pay a heavy atonement (with
      emphasis laying her hand on SOPHY'S shoulder)? Believe me, Sophy, woman
      has but to choose between ruling and serving, but the utmost joy of power
      is a worthless possession if the mightier joy of being slave to the man we
      love be denied us.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. A truth, dear lady, which I could least of all have expected to
      hear from your lips!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. And wherefore, Sophy? Does not woman show, by her childish
      mode of swaying the sceptre of power, that she is only fit to go in
      leading-strings! Have not my fickle humors&mdash;my eager pursuit of wild
      dissipation&mdash;betrayed to you that I sought in these to stifle the
      still wilder throbbings of my heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY (starting back with surprise). This from you, my lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (continuing with increasing energy). Appease these
      throbbings. Give me the man in whom my thoughts are centered&mdash;the man
      I adore, without whom life were worse than death. Let me but hear from his
      lips that the tears of love with which my eyes are bedewed outvie the gems
      that sparkle in my hair, and I will throw at the feet of the prince his
      heart and his dukedom, and flee to the uttermost parts of the earth with
      the man of my love!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY (looking at her in alarm). Heavens! my lady! control your emotion&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (in surprise). You change color! To what have I given
      utterance? Yet, since I have said thus much, let me say still more&mdash;let
      my confidence be a pledge of your fidelity,&mdash;I will tell you all.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY (looking anxiously around). I fear my lady&mdash;I dread it&mdash;I
      have heard enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. This alliance with the major&mdash;you, like the rest of the
      world, believe to be the result of a court intrigue&mdash;Sophy, blush not&mdash;be
      not ashamed of me&mdash;it is the work of&mdash;my love!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. Heavens! As I suspected!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Yes, Sophy, they are all deceived. The weak prince&mdash;the
      diplomatic baron&mdash;the silly marshal&mdash;each and all of these are
      firmly convinced that this marriage is a most infallible means of
      preserving me to the prince, and of uniting us still more firmly! But this
      will prove the very means of separating us forever, and bursting asunder
      these execrable bonds. The cheater cheated&mdash;outwitted by a weak
      woman. Ye yourselves are leading me to the man of my heart&mdash;this was
      all I sought. Let him but once be mine&mdash;be but mine&mdash;then, oh,
      then, a long farewell to all this despicable pomp!

    <p>
      VALET. Yesterday seven thousand children of the land left their homes to
      go to America&mdash;they pay for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (sets the casket suddenly down, and paces up and down the
      room; after a pause, to the VALET). What distresses you, old man? you are
      weeping!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALET (wiping his eyes, and trembling violently). Yes, for these jewels.
      My two sons are among the number.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. But they went not by compulsion?
    </p>
    <p>
      VALET (laughing bitterly). Oh! dear no! they were all volunteers! There
      were certainly some few forward lads who pushed to the front of the ranks
      and inquired of the colonel at what price the prince sold his subjects per
      yoke, upon which our gracious ruler ordered the regiments to be marched to
      the parade, and the malcontents to be shot. We heard the report of the
      muskets, and saw brains and blood spurting about us, while the whole band
      shouted&mdash;"Hurrah for America!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. And I heard nothing of all this! saw nothing!
    </p>
    <p>
      VALET. No, most gracious lady, because you rode off to the bear-hunt with
      his highness just at the moment the drum was beating for the march. 'Tis a
      pity your ladyship missed the pleasure of the sight&mdash;here, crying
      children might be seen following their wretched father&mdash;there, a
      mother distracted with grief was rushing forward to throw her tender
      infant among the bristling bayonets&mdash;here, a bride and bridegroom
      were separated with the sabre's stroke&mdash;and there, graybeards were
      seen to stand in despair, and fling their very crutches after their sons
      in the New World &mdash;and, in the midst of all this, the drums were
      beating loudly, that the prayers and lamentations might not reach the
      Almighty ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (rising in violent emotion). Away with these jewels&mdash;their
      rays pierce my bosom like the flames of hell. Moderate your grief, old
      man. Your children shall be restored to you. You shall again clasp them to
      your bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALET (with warmth). Yes, heaven knows! We shall meet again! As they
      passed the city gates they turned round and cried aloud: "God bless our
      wives and children&mdash;long life to our gracious sovereign. At the day
      of judgment we shall all meet again!"
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (walks up and down the room in great agitation). Horrible!
      most horrible!&mdash;and they would persuade me that I had dried up all
      the tears in the land. Now, indeed, my eyes are fearfully opened! Go&mdash;tell
      the prince that I will thank him in person! (As the valet is going she
      drops the purse into his hat.) And take this as a recompense for the truth
      you have revealed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      VALET (throws the purse with contempt on the table). Keep it, with your
      other treasures. [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (looking after him in astonishment). Sophy, follow him, and
      inquire his name. His sons shall be restored to him. (SOPHY goes. LADY
      MILFORD becomes absorbed in thought. Pause. Then to SOPHY as she returns.)
      Was there not a report that some town on the frontier had been destroyed
      by fire, and four hundred families reduced to beggary? (She rings.)
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. What has made your ladyship just think of that? Yes&mdash;such was
      certainly the fact, and most of these poor creatures are either compelled
      to serve their creditors as bondsmen, or are dragging out their miserable
      days in the depths of the royal silver mines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter a SERVANT. What are your ladyship's commands?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (giving him the case of jewels). Carry this to my treasurer
      without delay. Let the jewels be sold and the money distributed among the
      four hundred families who were ruined by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. Consider, my lady, the risk you run of displeasing his highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (with dignity). Should I encircle my brows with the curses of
      his subjects? (Makes a sign to the servant, who goes away with the jewel
      case.) Wouldst thou have me dragged to the earth by the dreadful weight of
      the tears of misery? Nay! Sophy, it is better far to wear false jewels on
      the brow, and to have the consciousness of a good deed within the breast!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. But diamonds of such value! Why not rather give some that are less
      precious? Truly, my lady, it is an unpardonable act.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Foolish girl! For this deed more brilliants and pearls will
      flow for me in one moment than kings ever wore in their richest diadems!
      Ay, and infinitely more beautiful!
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANT enters. Major von Walter!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY (running hastily to the help of LADY MILFORD, who seems fainting).
      Heavens, my lady, you change color!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. The first man who ever made me tremble. (To the SERVANT.) I
      am not well&mdash;but stay&mdash;what said the major?&mdash;how? O Sophy!
      I look sadly ill, do I not?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. I entreat you, my lady, compose yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANT. Is it your ladyship's wish that I should deny you to the major?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (hesitating). Tell him&mdash;I shall be happy to see him.
      (Exit SERVANT.) What shall I say to him, Sophy? how shall I receive him? I
      will be silent&mdash;alas! I fear he will despise my weakness. He will&mdash;ah,
      me! what sad forebodings oppress my heart! You are going Sophy! stay, yet&mdash;no,
      no&mdash;he comes&mdash;yes, stay, stay with me&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHY. Collect yourself, my lady, the major&mdash;&mdash;

      SCENE III.&mdash;FERDINAND VON WALTER. The former.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FERDINAND (with a slight bow). I hope I do not interrupt your ladyship?
    </h3>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (with visible emotion). Not at all, baron&mdash;not in the
      least.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I wait on your ladyship, at the command of my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Therein I am his debtor.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. And I am charged to announce to you that our marriage is
      determined on. Thus far I fulfil the commission of my father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (changing color and trembling). And not of your own heart?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Ministers and panders have no concern with hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (almost speechless with emotion). And you yourself&mdash;have
      you nothing to add?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (looking at SOPHY). Much! my lady, much!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (motions to SOPHY to withdraw). May I beg you to take a seat
      by my side?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I will be brief, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Well!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I am a man of honor!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Whose worth I know how to appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I am of noble birth!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Noble as any in the land!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. A soldier!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (in a soft, affectionate manner). Thus far you have only
      enumerated advantages which you share in common with many others. Why are
      you so silent regarding those noble qualities which are peculiarly your
      own?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (coldly). Here they would be out of place.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (with increasing agitation). In what light am I to understand
      this prelude?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (slowly, and with emphasis). As the protest of the voice of
      honor&mdash;should you think proper to enforce the possession of my hand!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (starting with indignation). Major von Walter! What language
      is this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (calmly). The language of my heart&mdash;of my unspotted name&mdash;and
      of this true sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Your sword was given to you by the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. 'Twas the state which gave it, by the hands of the prince. God
      bestowed on me an honest heart. My nobility is derived from a line of
      ancestry extending through centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. But the authority of the prince&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (with warmth). Can he subvert the laws of humanity, or stamp
      glory on our actions as easily as he stamps value on the coin of his
      realm? He himself is not raised above the laws of honor, although he may
      stifle its whispers with gold&mdash;and shroud his infamy in robes of
      ermine! But enough of this, lady!&mdash;it is too late now to talk of
      blasted prospects&mdash;or of the desecration of ancestry&mdash;or of that
      nice sense of honor&mdash;girded on with my sword&mdash;or of the world's
      opinion. All these I am ready to trample under foot as soon as you have
      proved to me that the reward is not inferior to the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (in extreme distress turning away). Major! I have not
      deserved this!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (taking her hand). Pardon me, lady&mdash;we are without
      witnesses. The circumstance which brings us together to-day&mdash;and only
      to-day&mdash; justifies me, nay, compels me, to reveal to you my most
      secret feelings. I cannot comprehend, lady, how a being gifted with so
      much beauty and spirit&mdash;qualities which a man cannot fail to admire&mdash;could
      throw herself away on a prince incapable of valuing aught beyond her mere
      person&mdash;and yet not feel some visitings of shame, when she steps
      forth to offer her heart to a man of honor!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (looking at him with an air of pride). Say on, sir, without
      reserve.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You call yourself an Englishwoman&mdash;pardon me, lady, I can
      hardly believe you. The free-born daughter of the freest people under
      heaven&mdash;a people too proud to imitate even foreign virtues&mdash;would
      surely never have sold herself to foreign vices! It is not possible, lady,
      that you should be a native of Britain, unless indeed your heart be as
      much below as the sons of Britannia vaunt theirs to be above all others!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Have you done, sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Womanly vanity&mdash;passions&mdash;temperament&mdash;a natural
      appetite for pleasure&mdash;all these might, perhaps, be pleaded in
      extenuation&mdash;for virtue often survives honor&mdash;and many who once
      trod the paths of infamy have subsequently reconciled themselves to
      society by the performance of noble deeds, and have thus thrown a halo of
      glory round their evil doings&mdash;but if this were so, whence comes the
      monstrous extortion that now oppresses the people with a weight never
      before known? This I would ask in the name of my fatherland&mdash;and now,
      lady, I have done!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (with gentleness and dignity). This is the first time, Baron
      von Walter, that words such as these have been addressed to me&mdash;and
      you are the only man to whom I would in return have vouchsafed an answer.
      Your rejection of my hand commands my esteem. Your invectives against my
      heart have my full forgiveness, for I will not believe you sincere, since
      he who dares hold such language to a woman, that could ruin him in an
      instant&mdash;must either believe that she possesses a great and noble
      heart&mdash; or must be the most desperate of madmen. That you ascribe the
      misery of this land to me may He forgive, before whose throne you, and I,
      and the prince shall one day meet! But, as in my person you have insulted
      the daughter of Britain, so in vindication of my country's honor you must
      hear my exculpation.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (leaning on his sword). Lady, I listen with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Hear, then, that which I have never yet breathed to mortal,
      and which none but yourself will ever learn from my lips. I am not the low
      adventurer you suppose me, sir! Nay! did I listen to the voice of pride, I
      might even boast myself to be of royal birth; I am descended from the
      unhappy Thomas Norfolk, who paid the penalty of his adherence to the cause
      of Mary, Queen of Scots, by a bloody death on the scaffold. My father,
      who, as royal chamberlain, had once enjoyed his sovereign's confidence,
      was accused of maintaining treasonable relations with France, and was
      condemned and executed by a decree of the Parliament of Great Britain. Our
      estates were confiscated, and our family banished from their native soil.
      My mother died on the day of my father's execution, and I&mdash;then a
      girl of fourteen&mdash;fled to Germany with one faithful attendant. A
      casket of jewels, and this crucifix, placed in my bosom by my dying
      mother, were all my fortune!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [FERDINAND, absorbed in thought, surveys LADY MILFORD with looks of
   compassion and sympathy.
</pre>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (continuing with increased emotion). Without a name&mdash;
      without protection or property&mdash;a foreigner and an orphan, I reached
      Hamburg. I had learnt nothing but a little French, and to run my fingers
      over the embroidery frame, or the keys of my harpsichord. But, though I
      was ignorant of all useful arts, I had learnt full well to feast off gold
      and silver, to sleep beneath silken hangings, to bid attendant pages obey
      my voice, and to listen to the honeyed words of flattery and adulation.
      Six years passed away in sorrow and in sadness&mdash;the remnant of my
      scanty means was fast melting away&mdash;my old and faithful nurse was no
      more&mdash;and&mdash; and then it was that fate brought your sovereign to
      Hamburg. I was walking beside the shores of the Elbe, wondering, as I
      gazed on its waters, whether they or my sorrows were the deeper, when the
      duke crossed my path. He followed me, traced me to my humble abode, and,
      casting himself at my feet, vowed that he loved me. (She pauses, and,
      after struggling with her emotion, continues in a voice choked by tears.)
      All the images of my happy childhood were revived in hues of delusive
      brightness&mdash;while the future lowered before me black as the grave. My
      heart panted for communion with another&mdash;and I sank into the arms
      opened to receive me! (Turning away.) And now you condemn me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (greatly agitated, follows her and leads her back). Lady!
      heavens! what do I hear! What have I done? The guilt of my conduct is
      unveiled in all its deformity! It is impossible you should forgive me.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (endeavoring to overcome her emotion). Hear me on! The
      prince, it is true, overcame my unprotected youth, but the blood of the
      Howards still glowed within my veins, and never ceased to reproach me;
      that I, the descendant of royal ancestors, should stoop to be a prince's
      paramour! Pride and destiny still contended in my bosom, when the duke
      brought me hither, where SCENEs the most revolting burst upon my sight!
      The voluptuousness of the great is an insatiable hyena&mdash;the craving
      of whose appetite demands perpetual victims. Fearfully had it laid this
      country waste separating bridegroom and bride&mdash;and tearing asunder
      even the holy bonds of marriage. Here it had destroyed the tranquil
      happiness of a whole family&mdash;there the blighting pest had seized on a
      young and inexperienced heart, and expiring victims called down bitter
      imprecations on the heads of the undoers. It was then that I stepped forth
      between the lamb and the tiger, and, in a moment of dalliance, extorted
      from the duke his royal promise that this revolting licentiousness should
      cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (pacing the room in violent agitation). No more, lady! No more!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. This gloomy period was succeeded by one still more gloomy.
      The court swarmed with French and Italian adventurers&mdash;the royal
      sceptre became the plaything of Parisian harlots, and the people writhed
      and bled beneath their capricious rule. Each had her day. I saw them sink
      before me, one by one, for I was the most skilful coquette of all! It was
      then that I seized and wielded the tyrant's sceptre whilst he slumbered
      voluptuously in my embrace&mdash;then, Walter, thy country, for the first
      time, felt the hand of humanity, and reposed in confidence on my bosom. (A
      pause, during which she gazes upon him with tenderness.) Oh! 'that the
      man, by whom, of all others, I least wish to be misunderstood, should
      compel me to turn braggart and parade my unobtrusive virtues to the glare
      of admiration! Walter, I have burst open the doors of prisons&mdash;I have
      cancelled death-warrants and shortened many a frightful eternity upon the
      galleys. Into wounds beyond my power to heal I have at least poured
      soothing balsam. I have hurled mighty villains to the earth, and oft with
      the tears of a harlot saved the cause of innocence from impending ruin.
      Ah! young man, how sweet were then my feelings! How proudly did these
      actions teach my heart to support the reproaches of my noble blood! And
      now comes the man who alone can repay me for all that I have suffered&mdash;the
      man, whom perhaps my relenting destiny created as a compensation for
      former sorrows&mdash;the man, whom with ardent affection, I already
      clasped in my dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (interrupting her). Hold, lady, hold! You exceed the bounds of
      our conference! You undertook to clear yourself from reproach, and you
      make me a criminal! Spare me, I beseech you! Spare a heart already
      overwhelmed by confusion and remorse!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (grasping his hand). You must hear me, Walter! hear me now or
      never. Long enough has the heroine sustained me; now you must feel the
      whole weight of these tears! Mark me, Walter! Should an unfortunate&mdash;impetuously,
      irresistibly attracted towards you&mdash;clasp you to her bosom full of
      unutterable, inextinguishable love&mdash;should this unfortunate&mdash;bowed
      down with the consciousness of shame&mdash;disgusted with vicious
      pleasures&mdash;heroically exalted by the inspiration of virtue&mdash;throw
      herself&mdash;thus into your arms (embracing him in an eager and
      supplicating manner); should she do this, and you still pronounce the
      freezing word "Honor!" Should she pray that through you she might be saved&mdash;that
      through you she might be restored to her hopes of heaven! (Turning away
      her head, and speaking in a hollow, faltering voice.) Or should she, her
      prayer refused, listen to the voice of despair, and to escape from your
      image plunge herself into yet more fearful depths of infamy and vice&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (breaking from her in great emotion). No, by heaven! This is
      more than I can endure! Lady, I am compelled&mdash;Heaven and earth
      compels me&mdash;to make the honest avowal of my sentiments and situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (hastening from him). Oh! not now! By all that is holy I
      entreat you&mdash;spare me in this dreadful moment when my lacerated heart
      bleeds from a thousand wounds. Be your decision life or death&mdash;I dare
      not&mdash;I will not hear it!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I entreat you, lady! I insist! What I have to say will mitigate
      my offence, and warmly plead your forgiveness for the past. I have been
      deceived in you, lady. I expected&mdash;nay, I wished to find you
      deserving my contempt. I came determined to insult you, and to make myself
      the object of your hate. Happy would it have been for us both had my
      purpose succeeded! (He pauses; then proceeds in a gentle and faltering
      voice.) Lady, I love!&mdash;I love a maid of humble birth&mdash;Louisa
      Miller is her name, the daughter of a music-master. (LADY MILFORD turns
      away pale and greatly agitated.) I know into what an abyss I plunge
      myself; but, though prudence bids me conceal my passion, honor overpowers
      its precepts. I am the criminal&mdash;I first destroyed the golden calm of
      Louisa's innocence&mdash;I lulled her heart with aspiring hopes, and
      surrendered it, like a betrayer, a prey to the wildest of passions. You
      will bid me remember my rank&mdash;my birth&mdash;my father&mdash;schemes
      of aggrandisement. But in vain&mdash;I love! My hopes become more fervent
      as the breach widens between nature and the mere conventions of society&mdash;
      between my resolution and worldly prejudices! We shall see whether love or
      interest is victorious. (LADY MILFORD during this has retired to the
      extreme end of the apartment, and covers her face with both hands.
      FERDINAND approaches her.) Have you aught to answer, lady?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (in a tone of intense suffering). Nothing! Nothing! but that
      you destroy yourself and me&mdash;and, with us yet a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. A third?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Never can you marry Louisa; never can you be happy with me.
      We shall all be the victims of your father's rashness. I can never hope to
      possess the heart of a husband who has been forced to give me his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Forced, lady? Forced? And yet given? Will you enforce a hand
      without a heart? Will you tear from a maiden a man who is the whole world
      to her? Will you tear a maiden from a man who has centered all his hopes
      of happiness on her alone? Will you do this, lady? you who but a moment
      before were the lofty, noble-minded daughter of Britain?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. I will because I must! (earnestly and firmly). My passions,
      Walter, overcome my tenderness for you. My honor has no alternative. Our
      union is the talk of the whole city. Every eye, every shaft of ridicule is
      bent against me. 'Twere a stain which time could never efface should a
      subject of the prince reject my hand! Appease your father if you have the
      power! Defend yourself as you best may! my resolution is taken. The mine
      is fired and I abide the issue.

      SCENE IV.&mdash;Miller's House.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   MILLER meeting LOUISA and MRS. MILLER.
</pre>
    <p>
      MILLER. Ay! ay! I told you how it would be!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (hastening to him with anxiety). What, father? What?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (running up and down the room). My cloak, there. Quick, quick! I
      must be beforehand with him. My cloak, I say! Yes, yes! this was just what
      I expected!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. For God's sake, father! tell me?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. What is the matter, Miller? What alarms you?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (throwing down his wig). Let that go to the friezer. What is the
      matter, indeed? And my beard, too, is nearly half an inch long. What's the
      matter? What do you think, you old carrion. The devil has broke loose, and
      you may look out for squalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. There, now, that's just the way! When anything goes wrong it
      is always my fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Your fault? Yes, you brimstone fagot! and whose else should it be?
      This very morning when you were holding forth about that confounded major,
      did I not say then what would be the consequence? That knave, Worm, has
      blabbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. Gracious heavens! But how do you know?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. How do I know? Look yonder! a messenger of the minister is already
      at the door inquiring for the fiddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (turning pale, and sitting down). Oh! God! I am in agony!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. And you, too, with that languishing air? (laughs bitterly). But,
      right! Right! There is an old saying that where the devil keeps a
      breeding-cage he is sure to hatch a handsome daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. But how do you know that Louisa is in question? You may have
      been recommended to the duke; he may want you in his orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (jumping up, and seizing his fiddlestick). May the sulphurous rain
      of hell consume thee! Orchestra, indeed! Ay, where you, you old procuress,
      shall howl the treble whilst my smarting back groans the base (Throwing
      himself upon a chair.) Oh! God in heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (sinks on the sofa, pale as death). Father! Mother! Oh! my heart
      sinks within me.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (starting up with anger). But let me only lay hands on that
      infernal quill-driver! I'll make him skip&mdash;be it in this world or the
      next; if I don't pound him to a jelly, body and soul; if I don't write all
      the Ten Commandments, the seven Penitential Psalms, the five books of
      Moses, and the whole of the Prophets upon his rascally hide so distinctly
      that the blue hieroglyphics shall be legible at the day of judgment&mdash;if
      I don't, may I&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. Yes, yes, curse and swear your hardest! That's the way to
      frighten the devil! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, gracious heavens! What shall
      we do? Who can advise us? Speak, Miller, speak; this silence distracts me!
      (She runs screaming up and down the room.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. I will instantly to the minister! I will open my mouth boldly, and
      tell him all from beginning to end. You knew it before me, and ought to
      have given me a hint of what was going on! The girl might yet have been
      advised. It might still have been time to save her! But, no! There was
      something for your meddling and making, and you must needs add fuel to the
      fire. Now you have made your bed you may lie on it. As you have brewed so
      you may drink; I shall take my daughter under my arm and be off with her
      over the borders.

   MILLER, MRS. MILLER, LOUISA, FERDINND.

    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 FERDINAND (rushes in, terrified, and out of breath). Has my father
 been here?

 LOUISA (starts back in horror). His father? Gracious heaven!

 MRS. MILLER (wringing her hands). The minister here? Then it's all
 over with us!

 MILLER (laughs bitterly). Thank God! Thank God! Now comes our
 benefit!
</pre>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (rushing towards LOUISA, and clasping her in his arms). Mine
      thou art, though heaven and hell were placed between us!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I am doomed! Speak, Ferdinand! Did you not utter that dreaded
      name? Your father?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Be not alarmed! the danger has passed! I have thee again! again
      thou hast me! Let me regain my breath on thy dear bosom. It was a dreadful
      hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. What was a dreadful hour? Answer me, Ferdinand! I die with
      apprehension!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (drawing back, gazing upon her earnestly, then in a solemn
      tone). An hour, Louisa, when another's form stepped between my heart and
      thee&mdash;an hour in which my love grew pale before my conscience&mdash;when
      Louisa ceased to be all in all to Ferdinand!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   [LOUISA sinks back upon her chair, and conceals her face.
</pre>
    <p>
      (FERDINAND stands before her in speechless agitation, then turns away from
      her suddenly and exclaims). Never, never! Baroness, 'tis impossible! you
      ask too much! Never can I sacrifice this innocence at your shrine. No, by
      the eternal God! I cannot recall my oath, which speaks to me from thy soul&mdash;thrilling
      eyes louder than the thunders of heaven! Behold, lady! Inhuman father,
      look on this! Would you have me destroy this angel? Shall my perfidy
      kindle a hell in this heavenly bosom? (turning towards her with firmness).
      No! I will bear her to thy throne, Almighty Judge! Thy voice shall declare
      if my affection be a crime. (He grasps her hand, and raises her from the
      sofa.) Courage, my beloved!&mdash;thou hast conquered&mdash;and I come
      forth a victor from the terrible conflict!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. No, no, Ferdinand, conceal nothing from me! Declare boldly the
      dreadful decree! You named your father! You spoke of the baroness! The
      shivering of death seizes my heart! 'Tis said she is about to be married!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (quite overcome, throws himself at her feet). Yes, and to me,
      dear unfortunate. Such is my father's will!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (after a deep pause, in a tremulous voice, but with assumed
      resignation). Well! Why am I thus affrighted? Has not my dear father often
      told me that you never could be mine? But I was obstinate, and believed
      him not. (A second pause; she falls weeping into her father's arms.)
      Father, thy daughter is thine own again! Father, forgive me! 'Twas not
      your child's fault that the dream was so heavenly&mdash;the waking so
      terrible!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Louisa! Louisa! O merciful heaven! she has lost her senses! My
      daughter! My poor child! Curses upon thy seducer! Curses upon the
      pandering mother who threw thee in his way!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER (weeping on LOUISA'S neck). Daughter, do I deserve this curse?
      God forgive you, major! What has this poor lamb done that you bring this
      misery upon her?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (with resolution). I will unravel the meshes of these intrigues.
      I will burst asunder these iron chains of prejudice. As a free-born man
      will I make my choice, and crush these insect souls with the colossal
      force of my love! [Going.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (rises trembling from the sofa, and attempts to follow him). Stay,
      oh, stay! Whither are you going? Father! Mother! He deserts us in this
      fearful hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER (hastens towards him, and detains him). The president is
      coming hither? He will ill-use my child! He will ill-use us all,&mdash;and
      yet, major, you are going to leave us.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (laughs hysterically). Leave us. Of course he is! What should
      hinder him? The girl has given him all she had. (Grasping FERDINAND with
      one hand, and LOUISA with the other.) Listen to me, young gentleman. The
      only way out of my house is over my daughter's body. If you possess one
      single spark of honor await your father's coming; tell him, deceiver, how
      you stole her young and inexperienced heart; or, by the God who made me!
      (thrusting LOUISA towards him with violence and passion) you shall crush
      before my eyes this trembling worm whom love for you has brought to shame
      and infamy!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (returns, and walks to and fro in deep thought). 'Tis true, the
      President's power is great&mdash;parental authority is a mighty word&mdash;even
      crimes claim respect when concealed within its folds. He may push that
      authority far&mdash;very far! But love goes beyond it. Hear me, Louisa;
      give me thy hand! (clasping it firmly). As surely as I hope for Heaven's
      mercy in my dying hour, I swear that the moment which separates these
      hands shall also rend asunder the thread that binds me to existence!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. You terrify me! Turn from me! Your lips tremble! Your eyes roll
      fearfully!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Nay, Louisa! fear nothing! It is not madness which prompts my
      oath! 'tis the choicest gift of Heaven, decision, sent to my aid at that
      critical moment, when an oppressed bosom can only find relief in some
      desperate remedy. I love thee, Louisa! Thou shalt be mine! 'Tis resolved!
      And now for my father!

   MILLER, MRS. MILLER, LOUISA, FERDINAND, PRESIDENT, with SERVANTS.

    <p>
      PRESIDENT (as he enters). So! here he is! (All start in terror.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (retiring a few paces). In the house of innocence!

    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. I am Miller, the musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (to MRS. MILLER). And you, the mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. Yes, alas! her unfortunate mother!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (to MILLER.) Father, take Louisa to her chamber&mdash;she is
      fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. An unnecessary precaution! I will soon arouse her. (To LOUISA.)
      How long have you been acquainted with the President's son?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with timidity). Of the President's son I have never thought.
      Ferdinand von Walter has paid his addresses to me since November last.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. And he adores her!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (to LOUISA). Has he given you any assurance of his love?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. But a few minutes since, the most solemn, and God was my
      witness.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (to his son angrily). Silence! You shall have opportunity enough
      of confessing your folly. (To LOUISA.) I await your answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. He swore eternal love to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. And I will keep my oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (to FERDINAND). Must I command your silence? (To LOUISA). Did
      you accept his rash vows?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with tenderness). I did, and gave him mine in exchange.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (resolutely). The bond is irrevocable&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (to FERDINAND). If you dare to interrupt me again I'll teach you
      better manners. (To LOUISA, sneeringly.) And he paid handsomely every
      time, no doubt?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I do not understand your question.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (with an insulting laugh). Oh, indeed! Well, I only meant to
      hint that&mdash;as everything has its price&mdash;I hope you have been
      more provident than to bestow your favors gratis&mdash;or perhaps you were
      satisfied with merely participating in the pleasure? Eh? how was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (infuriated). Hell and confusion! What does this mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (to FERDINAND, with dignity and emotion). Baron von Walter, now you
      are free!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Father! virtue though clothed in a beggar's garb commands
      respect!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (laughing aloud). A most excellent joke! The father is commanded
      to honor his son's strumpet!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh! Heaven and earth! (Sinks down in a swoon.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (drawing his sword). Father, you gave me life, and, till now, I
      acknowledged your claim on it. That debt is cancelled. (Replaces his sword
      in the scabbard, and points to LOUISA.) There lies the bond of filial duty
      torn to atoms!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (who has stood apart trembling, now comes forward, by turns
      gnashing his teeth in rage, and shrinking back in terror). Your
      excellency, the child is the father's second self. No offence, I hope! Who
      strikes the child hits the father&mdash;blow for blow&mdash;that's our
      rule here. No offence, I hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. God have mercy on us! Now the old man has begun&mdash;we
      shall all catch it with a vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (who has not understood what MILLER said). What? is the old
      pander stirred up? We shall have something to settle together presently,
      Mr. Pander!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. You mistake me, my lord. My name is Miller, at your service for an
      adagio&mdash;but, as to ladybirds, I cannot serve you. As long as there is
      such an assortment at court, we poor citizens can't afford to lay in
      stock! No offence, I hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      MRS. MILLER. For Heaven's sake, man, hold your tongue! would you ruin both
      wife and child?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (to his father). You play but a sorry part here, my lord, and
      might well have dispensed with these witnesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (coming nearer, with increasing confidence). To be plain and above
      board&mdash;No offence, I hope&mdash;your excellency may have it all your
      own way in the Cabinet&mdash;but this is my house. I'm your most obedient,
      very humble servant when I wait upon you with a petition, but the rude,
      unmannerly intruder I have the right to bundle out&mdash;no offence, I
      hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (pale with anger, and approaching MILLER). What? What's that you
      dare to utter?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (retreating a few steps). Only a little bit of my mind sir&mdash;no
      offence, I hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (furiously). Insolent villain! Your impertinence shall procure
      you a lodging in prison. (To his servants). Call in the officers of
      justice! Away! (Some of the attendants go out. The PRESIDENT paces the
      stage with a furious air.) The father shall to prison; the mother and her
      strumpet daughter to the pillory! Justice shall lend her sword to my rage!
      For this insult will I have ample amends. Shall such contemptible
      creatures thwart my plans, and set father and son against each other with
      impunity? Tremble, miscreants! I will glut my hate in your destruction&mdash;the
      whole brood of you&mdash;father, mother, and daughter shall be sacrificed
      to my vengeance!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (to MILLER, in a collected and firm manner). Oh! not so! Fear
      not, friends! I am your protector. (Turning to the PRESIDENT, with
      deference). Be not so rash, father! For your own sake let me beg of you no
      violence. There is a corner of my heart where the name of father has never
      yet been heard. Oh! press not into that!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Silence, unworthy boy! Rouse not my anger to greater fury!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (recovering from a stupor). Wife, look you to your daughter! I fly
      to the duke. His highness' tailor&mdash;God be praised for reminding me of
      it at this moment&mdash;learns the flute of me&mdash;I cannot fail of
      success. (Is hastening off.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. To the duke, will you? Have you forgotten that I am the
      threshold over which you must pass, or failing, perish? To the duke, you
      fool? Try to reach him with your lamentations, when, reduced to a living
      skeleton, you lie buried in a dungeon five fathoms deep, where light and
      sound never enter; where darkness goggles at hell with gloating eyes!
      There gnash thy teeth in anguish; there rattle thy chains in despair, and
      groan, "Woe is me! This is beyond human endurance!"

      FERDINAND. Father, if I cannot prevent it, she must stand in the pillory&mdash;but
      by her side will also stand the son of the president. Do you still insist?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. The more entertaining will be the exhibition. Away with her!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I will pledge the honor of an officer's sword for her. Do you
      still insist?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Your sword is already familiar with disgrace. Away! away! You
      know my will.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (wrests LOUISA from the officer and holds her with one arm, with
      the other points his sword at her bosom.) Father, rather than tamely see
      my wife branded with infamy I will plunge this sword into her bosom. Do
      you still insist?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Do it, if the point be sharp enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (releases LOUISA, and looks wildly towards heaven). Be thou
      witness, Almighty God, that I have left no human means untried to save
      her! Forgive me now if I have recourse to hellish means. While you are
      leading her to the pillory (speaking loudly in the PRESIDENT'S ear), I
      will publish throughout the town a pleasant history of how a president's
      chair may be gained! [Exit.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (as if thunder-struck). How? What said he? Ferdinand! Release
      her instantly! (Rushes after his son.)

      SCENE I.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Room at the President's. Enter PRESIDENT and WORM.
</pre>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. That was an infernal piece of business!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Just what I feared, your excellency. Opposition may inflame the
      enthusiast, but never converts him.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. I had placed my whole reliance upon the success of this
      attempt. I made no doubt but if the girl were once publicly disgraced, he
      would be obliged as an officer and a gentleman to resign her.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. An admirable idea!&mdash;had you but succeeded in disgracing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. And yet&mdash;when I reflect on the matter coolly&mdash;I ought
      not to have suffered myself to be overawed. It was a threat which he never
      could have meant seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Be not too certain of that! There is no folly too gross for excited
      passion! You say that the baron has always looked upon government with an
      eye of disapprobation. I can readily believe it. The principles which he
      brought with him from college are ill-suited to our atmosphere. What have
      the fantastic visions of personal nobility and greatness of soul to do in
      court, where 'tis the perfection of wisdom to be great and little by
      turns, as occasion demands? The baron is too young and too fiery to take
      pleasure in the slow and crooked paths of intrigue. That alone can give
      impulse to his ambition which seems glorious and romantic!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (impatiently). But how will these sagacious remarks advance our
      affairs?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. They will point out to your excellency where the wound lies, and so,
      perhaps, help you to find a remedy. Such a character&mdash;pardon the
      observation&mdash;ought never to have been made a confidant, or should
      never have been roused to enmity. He detests the means by which you have
      risen to power! Perhaps it is only the son that has hitherto sealed the
      lips of the betrayer! Give him but a fair opportunity for throwing off the
      bonds imposed upon him by nature! only convince him, by unrelenting
      opposition to his passion, that you are no longer an affectionate father,
      and that moment the duties of a patriot will rush upon him with
      irresistible force! Nay, the high-wrought idea of offering so unparalleled
      a sacrifice at the shrine of justice might of itself alone have charms
      sufficient to reconcile him to the ruin of a parent!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Worm! Worm! To what a horrible abyss do you lead me!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Never fear, my lord, I will lead you back in safety! May I speak
      without restraint?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (throwing himself into a seat). Freely, as felon with felon.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Forgive me, then. It seems to me that you have to ascribe all your
      influence as president to the courtly art of intrigue; why not resort to
      the same means for attaining your ends as a father? I well remember with
      what seeming frankness you invited your predecessor to a game at piquet,
      and caroused half the night with him over bumpers of Burgundy; and yet it
      was the same night on which the great mine you had planned to annihilate
      him was to explode. Why did you make a public exhibition of enmity to the
      major? You should by no means have let it appear that you knew anything of
      his love affair. You should have made the girl the object of your attacks
      and have preserved the affection of your son; like the prudent general who
      does not engage the prime of the enemy's force but creates disaffection
      among the ranks?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. How could this have been effected?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. In the simplest manner&mdash;even now the game is not entirely lost!
      Forget for a time that you are a father. Do not contend against a passion
      which opposition only renders more formidable. Leave me to hatch, from the
      heat of their own passions, the basilisk which shall destroy them.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. I am all attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Either my knowledge of human character is very small, or the major
      is as impetuous in jealousy as in love. Make him suspect the girl's
      constancy,&mdash;whether probable or not does not signify. One grain of
      leaven will be enough to ferment the whole mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. But where shall we find that grain?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Now, then, I come to the point. But first explain to me how much
      depends upon the major's compliance. How far is it of consequence that the
      romance with the music-master's daughter should be brought to a conclusion
      and the marriage with Lady Milford effected?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. How can you ask me, Worm? If the match with Lady Milford is
      broken off I stand a fair chance of losing my whole influence; on the
      other hand, if I force the major's consent, of losing my head.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (with animation). Now have the kindness to listen to me. The major
      must be entangled in a web. Your whole power must be employed against his
      mistress. We must make her write a love-letter, address it to a third
      party, and contrive to drop it cleverly in the way of the major.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Absurd proposal! As if she would consent to sign her own
      death-warrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. She must do so if you will but let me follow my own plan. I know her
      gentle heart thoroughly; she has but two vulnerable sides by which her
      conscience can be attacked; they are her father and the major. The latter
      is entirely out of the question; we must, therefore, make the most of the
      musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. In what way?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. From the description your excellency gave me of what passed in his
      house nothing can be easier than to terrify the father with the threat of
      a criminal process. The person of his favorite, and of the keeper of the
      seals, is in some degree the representative of the duke himself, and he
      who offends the former is guilty of treason towards the latter. At any
      rate I will engage with these pretences to conjure up such a phantom as
      shall scare the poor devil out of his seven senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. But recollect, Worm, the affair must not be carried so far as
      to become serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Nor shall it. It shall be carried no further than is necessary to
      frighten the family into our toils. The musician, therefore, must be
      quietly arrested. To make the necessity yet more urgent, we may also take
      possession of the mother;&mdash;and then we begin to talk of criminal
      process, of the scaffold, and of imprisonment for life, and make the
      daughter's letter the sole condition of the parent's release.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Excellent! Excellent! Now I begin to understand you!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Louisa loves her father&mdash;I might say even to adoration! The
      danger which threatens his life, or at least his freedom&mdash;the
      reproaches of her conscience for being the cause of his misfortunes&mdash;the
      impossibility of ever becoming the major's wife&mdash;the confusion of her
      brain, which I take upon myself to produce&mdash;all these considerations
      make our plan certain of success. She must be caught in the snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. But my son&mdash;will he not instantly get scent of it? Will it
      not make him yet more desperate?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Leave that to me, your excellency! The old folks shall not be set at
      liberty till they and their daughter have taken the most solemn oath to
      keep the whole transaction secret, and never to confess the deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. An oath! Ridiculous! What restraint can an oath be?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. None upon us, my lord, but the most binding upon people of their
      stamp. Observe, how dexterously by this measure we shall both reach the
      goal of our desires. The girl loses at once the affection of her lover,
      and her good name; the parents will lower their tone, and, thoroughly
      humbled by misfortune, will esteem it an act of mercy, if, by giving her
      my hand, I re-establish their daughter's reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (shaking his head and smiling). Artful villain! I confess myself
      outdone&mdash;no devil could spin a finer snare! The scholar excels his
      master. The next question is, to whom must the letter be addressed&mdash;
      with whom to accuse her of having an intrigue?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. It must necessarily be some one who has all to gain or all to lose
      by your son's decision in this affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (after a moment's reflection). I can think of no one but the
      marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (shrugs his shoulders). The marshal! He would certainly not be my
      choice were I Louisa Miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. And why not? What a strange notion! A man who dresses in the
      height of fashion&mdash;who carries with him an atmosphere of eau de mille
      fleurs and musk&mdash;who can garnish every silly speech with a handful of
      ducats&mdash;could all this possibly fail to overcome the delicacy of a
      tradesman's daughter? No, no, my good friend, jealousy is not quite so
      hard of belief. I shall send for the marshal immediately. (Rings.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. While your excellency takes care of him, and of the fiddler's
      arrest, I will go and indite the aforesaid letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (seats himself at his writing-table). Do so; and, as soon as it
      is ready, bring it hither for my perusal.
    </p>

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   The PRESIDENT&mdash;MARSHALL KALB.
</pre>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (hastily). I have just looked in, en passant, my dear friend! How
      are you? How do you get on? We are to have the grand opera Dido to-night!
      Such a conflagration!&mdash;a whole town will be in flames!&mdash;you will
      come to the blaze of course&mdash;eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. I have conflagration enough in my own house, one that threatens
      the destruction of all I possess. Be seated, my dear marshal. You arrive
      very opportunely to give me your advice and assistance in a certain
      business which will either advance our fortunes or utterly ruin us both!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Don't alarm me so, my dear friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. As I said before, it must exalt or ruin us entirely! You know
      my project respecting the major and Lady Milford&mdash;you are not
      ignorant how necessary this union is to secure both our fortunes! Marshal,
      our plans threaten to come to naught. My son refuses to marry her!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Refuses! Refuses to marry her? But, my goodness! I have published
      the news through the whole town. The union is the general topic of
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Then you will be talked of by all the town as a spreader of
      false reports,&mdash;in short, Ferdinand loves another.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Pooh! you are joking! As if that were an obstacle?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. With such an enthusiast a most insurmountable one!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Can he be mad enough to spurn his good-fortune? Eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Ask him yourself and you'll hear what he will answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. But, mon Dieu! what can he answer?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. That he will publish to the world the crime by which we rose to
      power&mdash;that he will denounce our forged letters and receipts&mdash;that
      he will send us both to the scaffold. That is what he can answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Are you out of your mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Nay, that is what he has already answered? He was actually on
      the point of putting these threats into execution; and it was only by the
      most abject submission that I could persuade him to abandon his design.
      What say you to this, marshal?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (with a look of bewildered stupidity). I am at my wits' end!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. That might have blown over. But my spies have just brought me
      notice that the grand cupbearer, von Bock, is on the point of offering
      himself as a suitor to her ladyship.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You drive me distracted! Whom did you say? Von Bock? Don't you
      know that we are mortal enemies? And don't you know why?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. The first word that I ever heard of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. My dear count! You shall hear&mdash;your hair will stand on end!
      You must remember the famous court ball&mdash;it is now just twenty years
      ago. It was the first time that English country-dances were introduced&mdash;you
      remember how the hot wax trickled from the great chandelier on Count
      Meerschaum's blue and silver domino. Surely, you cannot have forgotten
      that affair!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Who could forget so remarkable a circumstance!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Well, then, in the heat of the dance Princess Amelia lost her
      garter. The whole ball, as you may imagine, was instantly thrown into
      confusion. Von Bock and myself&mdash;we were then fellow-pages&mdash;crept
      through the whole saloon in search of the garter. At length I discovered
      it. Von Bock perceives my good-fortune&mdash;rushes forward&mdash;tears it
      from my hands, and, just fancy&mdash;presents it to the princess, and so
      cheated me of the honor I had so fortunately earned. What do you think of
      that?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. 'Twas most insolent!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. I thought I should have fainted upon the spot. A trick so
      malicious was beyond the powers of mortal endurance. At length I recovered
      myself; and, approaching the princess, said,&mdash;"Von Bock, 'tis true,
      was fortunate enough to present the garter to your highness; but he who
      first discovered that treasure finds his reward in silence, and is dumb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Bravo, marshal! Admirably said! Most admirable!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. And is dumb! But till the day of judgment will I remember his
      conduct&mdash;the mean, sneaking sycophant! And as if that were not
      aggravation enough, he actually, as we were struggling on the ground for
      the garter, rubbed all the powder from one side of my peruke with his
      sleeve, and ruined me for the rest of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. This is the man who will marry Lady Milford, and consequently
      soon take the lead at court.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You plunge a dagger in my heart! But why must he? Why should he
      marry her? Why he? Where is the necessity?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Because Ferdinand refuses her, and there is no other candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. But is there no possible method of obtaining your son's consent?
      Let the measure be ever so extravagant or desperate&mdash;there is nothing
      to which I should not willingly consent in order to supplant the hated von
      Bock.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. I know but one means of accomplishing this, and that rests
      entirely with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. With me? Name it, my dear count, name it!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. You must set Ferdinand and his mistress against each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Against each other? How do you mean?&mdash;and how would that be
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Everything is ours could we make him suspect the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Ah, of theft, you mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Pshaw!&mdash;he would never believe that! No, no&mdash;I mean
      that she is carrying on an intrigue with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. And this other, who is he to be?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Yourself!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. How? Must I be her lover? Is she of noble birth?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. What signifies that? What an idea!&mdash;she is the daughter of
      a musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. A plebeian?&mdash;that will never do!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. What will never do? Nonsense, man! Who in the name of wonder
      would think of asking a pair of rosy cheeks for their owner's pedigree?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. But consider, my dear count, a married man! And my reputation at
      court!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Oh! that's quite another thing! I beg a thousand pardons,
      marshal; I was not aware that a man of unblemished morals held a higher
      place in your estimation than a man of power! Let us break up our
      conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Be not so hasty, count. I did not mean to say that.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (coldly.) No&mdash;no! You are perfectly right. I, too, am weary
      of office. I shall throw up the game, tender my resignation to the duke,
      and congratulate von Bock on his accession to the premiership. This duchy
      is not all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. And what am I to do? It is very fine for you to talk thus! You
      are a man of learning! But I&mdash;mon Dieu! What shall I be if his
      highness dismisses me?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. A stale jest!&mdash;a thing out of fashion!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. I implore you, my dearest, my most valued friend. Abandon those
      thoughts. I will consent to everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Will you lend your name to an assignation to which this Louisa
      Miller shall invite you in writing?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Well, in God's name let it be so!
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. And drop the letter where the major cannot fail to find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. For instance, on the parade, where I can let it fall as if
      accidentally in drawing out my handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. And when the baron questions you will you assume the character
      of a favored rival?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Mort de ma vie! I'll teach him manners! I'll cure him of
      interfering in my amours!

    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Good! Now you speak in the right key. The letter shall be
      written immediately! Come in the evening to receive it, and we will talk
      over the part you are to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. I will be with you the instant I have paid sixteen visits of the
      very highest importance. Permit me, therefore, to take my leave without
      delay. (Going.)

    <p>

      SCENE IV.&mdash;Room in MILLER'S House.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LOUISA and FERDINAND.
</pre>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Cease, I implore you! I expect no more days of happiness. All my
      hopes are levelled with the dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. All mine are exalted to heaven! My father's passions are
      roused! He will direct his whole artillery against us! He will force me to
      become an unnatural son. I will not answer for my filial duty. Rage and
      despair will wring from me the dark secret that my father is an assassin!
      The son will deliver the parent into the hands of the executioner. This is
      a moment of extreme danger, and extreme danger alone could prompt my love
      to take so daring a leap! Hear me, Louisa! A thought, vast and
      immeasurable as my love, has arisen in my soul&mdash;Thou, Louisa, and I,
      and Love! Lies not a whole heaven within this circle? Or dost thou feel
      that there is still something wanting?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh! cease! No more! I tremble to think what you would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. If we have no longer a claim upon the world, why should we seek
      its approbation? Why venture where nothing can be gained and all may be
      lost? Will thine eyes sparkle less brightly reflected by the Baltic waves
      than by the waters of the Rhine or the Elbe? Where Louise loves me there
      is my native land! Thy footsteps will make the wild and sandy desert far
      more attractive than the marble halls of my ancestors. Shall we miss the
      pomp of cities? Be we where we may, Louisa, a sun will rise and a sun will
      set&mdash; SCENEs before which the most glorious achievements of art grow
      pale and dim! Though we serve God no more in his consecrated churches, yet
      the night shall spread her solemn shadows round us; the changing moon
      shall hear our confession, and a glorious congregation of stars join in
      our prayers! Think you our talk of love can ever be exhausted! Oh, no! One
      smile from Louisa were a theme for centuries&mdash;the dream of life will
      be over ere I can exhaust the charms of a single tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. And hast thou no duty save that of love?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (embracing her). None so sacred as thy peace of mind!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (very seriously). Cease, then, and leave me. I have a father who
      possesses no treasure save one only daughter. To-morrow he will be sixty
      years old&mdash;that he will fall a victim to the vengeance of the
      President is most certain!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (interrupting her). He shall accompany us. Therefore no more
      objections, my beloved. I will go and convert my valuables into gold, and
      raise money on my father's credit! It is lawful to plunder a robber, and
      are not his treasures the price for which he has sold his country? This
      night, when the clock strikes one, a carriage will stop at your door&mdash;throw
      yourself into it, and we fly!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Pursued by your father's curse! a curse, unthinking one, which is
      never pronounced in vain even by murderers&mdash;which the avenging angel
      hears when uttered by a malefactor in his last agony&mdash;which, like a
      fury, will fearfully pursue the fugitives from shore to shore! No, my
      beloved! If naught but a crime can preserve you to me, I still have
      courage to resign you!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (mutters gloomily). Indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Resign you? Oh! horrible beyond all measure is the thought.
      Horrible enough to pierce the immortal spirit and pale the glowing cheeks
      of joy! Ferdinand! To resign you! Yet how can one resign what one never
      possessed? Your heart is the property of your station. My claim was
      sacrilege, and, shuddering, I withdraw it!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (with convulsed features, and biting his underlip). You withdraw
      it!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Nay! look upon me, dearest Ferdinand. Gnash not your teeth so
      bitterly! Come, let my example rouse your slumbering courage. Let me be
      the heroine of this moment. Let me restore to a father his lost son. I
      will renounce a union which would sever the bonds by which society is held
      together, and overthrow the landmarks of social order. I am the criminal.
      My bosom has nourished proud and foolish wishes, and my present misery is
      a just punishment. Oh! leave me then the sweet, the consoling idea that
      mine is the sacrifice. Canst thou deny me this last satisfaction?
      (FERDINAND, stupefied with agitation and anger, seizes a violin and
      strikes a few notes upon it; and then tears away the strings, dashes the
      instrument upon the ground, and, stamping it to pieces, bursts into a loud
      laugh.) Walter! God in Heaven! What mean you? Be not thus unmanned! This
      hour requires fortitude; it is the hour of separation! You have a heart,
      dear Walter; I know that heart&mdash;warm as life is your love&mdash;boundless
      and immeasurable&mdash;bestow it on one more noble, more worthy&mdash;she
      need not envy the most fortunate of her sex! (Striving to repress her
      tears.) You shall see me no more! Leave the vain disappointed girl to
      bewail her sorrow in sad and lonely seclusion; where her tears will flow
      unheeded. Dead and gone are all my hopes of happiness in this world; yet
      still shall I inhale ever and anon the perfumes of the faded wreath!
      (Giving him her trembling hand, while her face is turned away.) Baron
      Walter, farewell!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (recovering from the stupor in which he was plunged). Louisa, I
      fly! Do you indeed refuse to follow me?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (who has retreated to the further end of the apartment, conceals
      her countenance with her hands). My duty bids me stay, and suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Serpent! thou liest&mdash;some other motive chains thee here!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (in a tone of the most heartfelt sorrow). Encourage that belief.
      Haply it may make our parting more supportable.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. What? Oppose freezing duty to fiery love! And dost thou think
      to cheat me with that delusion? Some rival detains thee here, and woe be
      to thee and him should my suspicions be confirmed!

      LOUISA (she remains for some time motionless in the seat upon which she
      has thrown herself. At length she rises, comes forward, and looks timidly
      around). Where can my parents be? My father promised to return in a few
      minutes; yet full five dreadful hours have passed since his departure.
      Should any accident&mdash;&mdash;good Heavens! What is come over me? Why
      does my heart palpitate so violently? (Here WORM enters, and remains
      standing unobserved in the background.) It can be nothing real. 'Tis but
      the terrible delusion of my over-heated blood. When once the soul is
      wrapped in terror the eye behold spectres in every shadow.

   LOUISA and WORM.
</pre>
    <p>
      WORM (approaches her). Good evening, miss.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Heavens! who speaks! (Perceives him, and starts back in terror.)
      Ha! Dreadful! dreadful! I fear some dire misfortune is even now realizing
      the forebodings of my soul! (To WORM, with a look of disdain.) Do you seek
      the president? he is no longer here.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. 'Tis you I seek, miss!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I wonder, then, that you did not direct your steps towards the
      market-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. What should I do there?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Release your betrothed from the pillory.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Louisa, you cherish some false suspicion&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (sharply interrupting him). What is your business with me?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. I come with a message from your father.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (agitated). From my father? Oh! Where is my father?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Where he would fain not be!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Quick, quick, for God's sake! Oh! my foreboding heart! Where is my
      father!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. In prison, if you needs must know!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with a look towards heaven). This, too! This, too! In prison, said
      you? And why in prison?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. It is the duke's order.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. The duke's?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Who thinking his own dignity offended by the insults offered to the
      person of his representative&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. How? How? Oh ye Almighty Powers!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM.&mdash;&mdash;Has resolved to inflict the most exemplary punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. This was still wanting! This! Yes, in truth. I now feel that my
      heart does love another besides Ferdinand! That could not be allowed to
      escape! The prince's dignity offended? Heavenly Providence! Save, oh! save
      my sinking faith! (After a moment's pause, she turns to WORM.) And
      Ferdinand?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Must choose between Lady Milford's hand and his father's curse and
      disinheritance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Terrible choice!&mdash;and yet&mdash;yet is he the happier of the
      two. He has no father to lose&mdash;and yet to have none is misery enough!
      My father imprisoned for treason&mdash;my Ferdinand compelled to choose
      between Lady Milford's hand or a parent's curse and disinheritance! Truly
      admirable! for even villany so perfect is perfection! Perfection? No!
      something is still wanting to complete that. Where is my mother?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. In the house of correction.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with a smile of despair). Now the measure is full! It is full, and
      I am free&mdash;released from all duties&mdash;all sorrows&mdash;all joys!
      Released even from Providence! I have nothing more to do with it! (A
      dreadful pause.) Have you aught else to communicate? Speak freely&mdash;now
      I can hear anything with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. All that has happened you already know.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. But not that which is yet to happen! (Another pause, during which
      she surveys WORM from head to foot.) Unfortunate man! you have entered on
      a melancholy employment, which can never lead you to happiness. To cause
      misery to others is sad enough&mdash;but to be the messenger of evil is
      horrible indeed&mdash;to be the first to shriek the screech-owl's song, to
      stand by when the bleeding heart trembles upon the iron shaft of
      necessity, and the Christian doubts the existence of a God&mdash;Heaven
      protect me! Wert thou paid a ton of gold for every tear of anguish which
      thou must witness, I would not be a wretch like thee! What is there yet to
      happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. I know not.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. You pretend not to know? This light-shunning embassy trembles at
      the sound of words, but the spectre betrays itself in your ghastly visage.
      What is there yet to happen? You said the duke will inflict upon him a
      most exemplary punishment. What call you exemplary?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Ask me no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Terrible man! Some hangman must have schooled thee! Else thou hast
      not so well learned to prolong the torture of thy victim before giving the
      finishing stroke to the agonized heart! Speak! What fate awaits my father?
      Death thou canst announce with a laughing sneer&mdash;what then must that
      be which thou dost hesitate to disclose? Speak out! Let me at once receive
      the overwhelming weight of thy tidings! What fate awaits my father?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. A criminal process.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. But what is that? I am an ignorant, innocent girl, and understand
      but little of your fearful terms of law. What mean you by a criminal
      process?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Judgment upon life or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (firmly). Ah! I thank you.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
               [Exit hastily by a side door.
</pre>
    <p>
      WORM (alarmed). What means this? Should the simpleton perchance&mdash;
      confusion! Surely she will not&mdash;I must follow her. I am answerable
      for her life. (As he is going towards the door, LOUISA returns, wrapped in
      a cloak.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Your pardon, Mr. Secretary, I must lock the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Whither in such haste?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (passing him). To the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (alarmed, detains her). How? Whither?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. To the duke. Do you not hear? Even to that very duke whose will is
      to decide upon my father's life or death. Yet no?&mdash;'tis not his will
      that decides, but the will of wicked men who surround his throne. He lends
      naught to this process, save the shadow of his majesty, and his royal
      signature.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (with a burst of laughter). To the duke!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I know the meaning of that sneering laugh&mdash;you would tell me
      that I shall find no compassion there. But though I may meet (God preserve
      me!) with nothing but scorn&mdash;scorn at my sorrows&mdash;yet will I to
      the duke. I have been told that the great never know what misery is; that
      they fly from the knowledge of it. But I will teach the duke what misery
      is; I will paint to him, in all the writhing agonies of death, what misery
      is; I will cry aloud in wailings that shall creep through the very marrow
      of his bones, what misery is; and, while at my picture his hairs shall
      stand on end like quills upon the porcupine, will I shriek into his
      affrighted ear, that in the hour of death the sinews of these mighty gods
      of earth shall shrivel and shrink, and that at the day of judgment beggars
      and kings shall be weighed together in the same balance (Going.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (ironically). By all means go to the duke! You can really do nothing
      more prudent; I advise you heartily to the step. Only go, and I give you
      my word that the duke will grant your suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (stopping suddenly). What said you? Do you yourself advise the
      step? (Returns hastily). What am I about to do? Something wicked surely,
      since this man approves it&mdash;how know you that the prince will grant
      my suit?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Because he will not have to grant it unrewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Not unrewarded? And what price does he set on his humanity?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. The person of the fair suppliant will be payment enough!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (stopping for a moment in mute dismay&mdash;in a feeble voice).
      Almighty God!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. And I trust that you will not think your father's life over-valued
      when 'tis purchased at so gracious a price.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with great indignation). True, oh! true! The great are entrenched
      from truth behind their own vices, safely as behind the swords of
      cherubim. The Almighty protect thee, father! Your child can die&mdash; but
      not sin for thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. This will be agreeable news for the poor disconsolate old man. "My
      Louisa," says he, "has bowed me down to the earth; but my Louisa will
      raise me up again." I hasten to him with your answer. (Affects to be about
      to depart.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (flies after him and holds him back). Stay! stay! one moment's
      patience! How nimble this Satan is, when his business is to drive humanity
      distracted! I have bowed him to the earth! I must raise him up again!
      Speak to me! Counsel me! What can I, what must I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. There is but one means of saving him!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. What is that means?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. And your father approves of it&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. My father? Oh! name that means.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. It is easy for you to execute.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I know of nothing harder than infamy!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Suppose you were to release the major from his engagement?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Release him! Do you mock me? Do you call that a choice to which
      force compelled me?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. You mistake me, dear girl! The major must resign you willingly, and
      be the first to retract his engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. That he will never do.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. So it appears. Should we, do you think, have had recourse to you
      were it not that you alone are able to help us?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I cannot compel him to hate me.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. We will try! Be seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (drawing back). Man! What is brooding in thy artful brain?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Be seated. Here are paper, pens, and ink. Write what I dictate.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (sitting down in the greatest uneasiness). What must I write? To
      whom must I write?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. To your father's executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Ah! How well thou knowest to torture souls to thy purpose. (Takes
      a pen.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (dictating to her). "My dear Sir (LOUISA writes with a trembling
      hand,) three days, three insupportable days, have already passed&mdash;already
      passed&mdash;since last we met."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (starts, and lays down her pen). To whom is the letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. To your father's executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh! my God!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "But for this you must blame the major&mdash;the major&mdash;who
      watches me all day with the vigilance of an Argus."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (starting up). Villany! Villany beyond all precedent! To whom is
      the letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. To your father's executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (paces to and fro, wringing her hands). No, no, no! This is
      tyrannical! Oh Heaven! If mortals provoke thee, punish them like mortals;
      but wherefore must I be placed between two precipices? Wherefore am I
      hurled by turns from death to infamy, from infamy to death? Wherefore is
      my neck made the footstool of this blood-sucking fiend? No; do what thou
      wilt, I will never write that!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (seizing his hat). As you please, miss! It rests entirely on your own
      pleasure!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Pleasure, say'st thou? On my own pleasure? Go, barbarian! Suspend
      some unfortunate over the pit of hell; then make your demands, and ask
      your victim if it be his pleasure to grant your request! Oh! Thou knowest
      but too well that the bonds of nature bind our hearts as firmly as chains!
      But all is now alike indifferent. Dictate! I cease to think! Artifices of
      hell, I yield to ye! (She resumes her seat at the table.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "With the vigilance of an Argus." Have you written it?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Proceed, proceed!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "The president was here yesterday. It was amusing to see how warm
      the poor major was in defence of my honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Excellent! Excellent! Oh! Admirable! Quick! quick, go on!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "I had recourse to a swoon&mdash;a swoon&mdash;that I might not
      laugh aloud"&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh, Heavens!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "But the mask which I have worn so long is becoming insupportable
      &mdash;insupportable. Oh! if I could but rid myself of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (rises, and walks a few turns with her head bent down, as if she
      sought something upon the floor: then returns to her place, and continues
      to write). "Rid myself of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "He will be on duty to-morrow&mdash;observe when he leaves me, and
      hasten to the usual place." Have you written "the usual place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Everything, everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "To the usual place, to meet your devotedly attached Louisa."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Now then, the address?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. "To Marshal von Kalb."
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Eternal Providence! A name as foreign to my ear as these
      scandalous lines are to my heart! (She rises, and for some moments surveys
      the writing with a vacant gaze. At length she hands it to WORM, speaking
      in a voice trembling and exhausted.) Take it, Sir! What I now put into
      your hands is my good name. It is Ferdinand&mdash;it is the whole joy of
      my life! You have it, and now I am a beggar&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. Oh! Not so! Despair not, dear girl! You inspire me with the most
      heartfelt pity! Perhaps&mdash;who knows? I might even now overlook certain
      parts of your conduct&mdash;yes! Heaven is my witness, how deeply I
      compassionate your sorrows!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (giving him a piercing look). Do not explain yourself! You are on
      the point of asking something more terrible than all.
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (attempting to kiss her hand). What if I asked this little hand?
      Would that be terrible, Louisa?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with great indignation). Yes! for I should strangle you on the
      bridal night: and for such a deed I would joyfully yield my body to be
      torn on the rack! (She is going, but comes hurriedly back.) Is all settled
      between us, sir? May the dove be released?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. A trifle yet remains, maiden! You must swear, by the holy sacrament,
      to acknowledge this letter for your free and voluntary act.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh God! Oh God! And wilt thou grant thine own seal to confirm the
      works of hell? (WORM leads her away.)

    <p>
      FERDINAND (hastily reading the letter, at one moment seeming petrified
      with astonishment, at the next pacing the room with fury). Impossible!
      quite impossible! A form so heavenly cannot hide so devilish a heart. And
      yet!&mdash;and yet! Though all the angels of heaven should descend on
      earth and proclaim her innocence&mdash;though heaven and earth, the
      Creator and the created, should, with one accord, vouch for her innocence&mdash;it
      is her hand, her own hand! Treachery, monstrous, infernal treachery, such
      as humanity never before witnessed! This, then, was the reason she so
      resolutely opposed our flight! This it was&mdash;Oh, God! Now I awake from
      my dream! Now the veil is lifted! This, then, is why she surrendered with
      so much seeming heroism her claims on my affection, and all but cheated me
      with her saint-like demeanor! (He traverses the chamber rapidly, and then
      remains for some moments in deep thought.) To fathom my heart to its very
      core! To reciprocate every lofty sentiment, every gentle emotion, every
      fiery ebullition! To sympathize with every secret breathing of my soul! To
      study me even in her tears! To mount with me to the sublimest heights of
      passion&mdash;to brave with me, undaunted, each fearful precipice! God of
      heaven! And was all this deceit? mere grimace? Oh, if falsehood can assume
      so lovely an appearance of truth why has no devil yet lied himself back
      into heaven?
    </p>
    <p>
      When I unfolded to her the dangers which threatened our affection, with
      what convincing artifice did the false one turn pale! With what
      overpowering dignity did she repulse my father's licentious scoffs! yet at
      that very moment the deceiver was conscious of her guilt! Nay, did she not
      even undergo the fiery ordeal of truth? Forsooth, the hypocrite fainted!
      What must now be thy language, sensibility, since coquettes faint? How
      wilt thou vindicate thyself, innocence?&mdash;for even strumpets faint?
    </p>
    <p>
      She knows her power over me&mdash;she has seen through my very heart! My
      soul shone conspicuous in my eyes at the blush of her first kiss. And that
      she should have felt nothing! or perhaps felt only the triumph of her art;
      whilst my happy delirium fancied that in her I embraced a whole heaven, my
      wildest wishes were hushed! No thought but of her and eternity was present
      to my mind. Oh, God! and yet she felt nothing? Nothing? but that her
      artifice had triumphed! That her charms were flattered! Death and
      vengeance! Nothing, but that I was betrayed!

<pre xml:space="preserve">
   FERDINAND, the MARSHAL.
</pre>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (tripping into the room). I am told, my dear baron, that you have
      expressed a wish&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (muttering to himself). To break your rascally neck. (Aloud.)
      Marshal, this letter must have dropped out of your pocket on parade. (With
      a malicious smile.) And I have been the fortunate finder.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. By a singular coincidence! Now, balance thy account with
      heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You quite alarm me, baron!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Read it, sir, read it! (Turning from him.) If I am not good
      enough for a lover perhaps I may do for a pimp. (While the MARSHAL reads,
      FERDINAND goes to the wall and takes down the pistols.)
    </p>
    <p>
      KALB (throws the letter upon the table, and rushes off). Confusion!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (leads him back by the arm). Wait a little, my dear marshal! The
      intelligence contained in that letter appears to be agreeable! The finder
      must have his reward. (Showing him the pistols.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (starts back in alarm). Have you lost your senses, baron?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in a terrible voice). I have more than enough left to rid the
      world of such a scoundrel as you! Choose one of these instantly! (He
      forces a pistol into the MARSHAL'S hand, and then draws out his
      handkerchief.) And now take the other end of this handkerchief! It was
      given me by the strumpet herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. What, shoot over the handkerchief? Baron, are you mad? What can
      you be thinking of?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Lay hold of it, I say! or you will be sure to miss your aim,
      coward! How the coward trembles! You should thank God, you pitiful coward,
      that you have a chance for once of getting something in your empty
      brain-box. (The MARSHAL takes to his heels.) Gently, gently! I'll take
      care of that. (Overtakes him and bolts the door.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Surely you will not fight in the chamber?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. As if you were worth the trouble of a walk beyond the
      boundaries! The report, my dear fellow, will be louder, and, for the first
      time, you will make some noise in the world. Now, then, take hold!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (wiping his forehead). Yet consider, I entreat. Would you risk
      your precious life, young and promising as you are, in this desperate
      manner?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Take hold, I say! I have nothing more to do in this world!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. But I have much, my dearest, most excellent friend!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Thou, wretch&mdash;thou? What hast thou to do, but to play the
      stop-gap, where honest men keep aloof! To stretch or shrink seven times in
      an instant, like the butterfly on a pin? To be privy registrar in chief
      and clerk of the jordan? To be the cap-and-bell buffoon on which your
      master sharpens his wit? Well, well, let it be so. I will carry you about
      with me, as I would a marmot of rare training. You shall skip and dance,
      like a tamed monkey, to the howling of the damned; fetch, carry, and
      serve; and with your courtly arts enliven the wailings of everlasting
      despair!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Anything you please, dear major! Whatever you please! Only take
      away the pistols!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. How he stands there, poor trembling wretch! There he stands, a
      blot on the sixth day of creation. He looks as if he were a piratical
      counterfeit of the Almighty original. Pity, eternal pity! that an atom of
      brains should lie wasting in so barren a skull! That single atom bestowed
      upon a baboon might have made him a perfect man, whereas it is now a mere
      useless fragment. And that she should share her heart with a thing like
      this! Monstrous! Incredible! A wretch more formed to wean from sin than to
      excite it!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Praised be Heaven! he is getting witty.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I will let him live! That toleration which spares the
      caterpillar shall be extended to him! Men shall look on him in wonder,
      and, shrugging their shoulders, admire the wise dispensation of
      Providence, which can feed its creatures with husks and scourings; which
      spreads the table for the raven on the gallows, and for the courtier in
      the slime of majesty. We wonder at the wisdom of Providence, which even in
      the world of spirits maintains its staff of venomous reptiles for the
      dissemination of poison. (Relapsing into rage.) But such vermin shall not
      pollute my rose; sooner will I crush it to atoms (seizing the MARSHAL and
      shaking him roughly), thus&mdash;and thus&mdash;and thus&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Oh! God, that I were away from here! hundreds of miles away in
      the asylum for maniacs at Paris! Anywhere but near this man!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Villain! If she be no longer pure! Villain! If thou hast
      profaned where I worshipped! (with increased fury). If thou hast polluted,
      where I believed myself the god! (Pausing suddenly; then in a solemn
      terrible voice.) It were better for thee, villain, to flee to hell, than
      to encounter my wrath in heaven! Confess! To what extent has your
      unhallowed love proceeded?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Let me go! I will confess everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Oh! it must be more rapturous even to be her licentious
      paramour than to burn with the purest flame for any other! Would she
      surrender her charms to unlicensed pleasure she might dissolve the soul
      itself to sin, and make voluptuousness pass for virtue (pressing his
      pistol against the MARSHAL'S breast). To what extremities have you
      proceeded? Confess this instant or I fire!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. There is nothing at all in it, I assure you! There is not a
      syllable of truth in the whole business! Have but a moment's patience! You
      are deceived, indeed you are!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (furiously). And dare you remind me of that, villain? To what
      extremities have you proceeded? Confess, or you are a dead man!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. Mon Dieu! My God! You mistake my words! Only listen for a moment.
      When a father&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (still more enraged). No doubt! He threw his daughter into your
      arms? And how far have you proceeded? Confess, or I will murder you!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You rave! You will not listen! I never saw her! I don't know her!
      I know nothing at all about her!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (drawing back). You never saw her? You don't know her? Know
      nothing at all about her? Louisa is lost to me forever on thy account, and
      yet in one breath hast thou denied her thrice. Go, wretch, go (he gives
      him a blow with the pistol, and thrusts him out of the chamber); powder
      were thrown away on such a miscreant.

      unfortunate, both are lost! Ay, by the Almighty God! if I am lost, thou
      art so too. Judge of the world, ask her not from me! She is mine. For her
      sake I renounced the whole world&mdash;abandoned all thy glorious
      creation. Leave me the maid, great Judge of the world! Millions of souls
      pour out their plaints to thee&mdash;turn on them thine eye of compassion,
      but leave me, Almighty Judge&mdash;leave me to myself. (Clasping his hands
      in agony.) Can the bountiful, the munificent Creator be covetous of one

    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Leave me, Sophia! Pity me! I must blush if she is but an
      ordinary woman&mdash;despair if she is more!
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHIA. But, my lady! it is not in this spirit that a rival should be
      received! Remember who you are! Summon to your aid your birth, your rank,
      your power! A prouder soul should heighten the gorgeous splendor of your
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (in a fit of absence). What is the simpleton babbling about?
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHIA (maliciously). Or, is it, perhaps, by chance that to-day, in
      particular, you are adorned with your most costly brilliants? by chance
      that you are to-day arrayed in your most sumptuous robes? that your
      antechamber is crowded with guards and pages; and that the tradesman's
      daughter is to be received in the most stately apartment of the palace?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (angry and nettled). This is outrageous! Insupportable! Oh
      that woman should have such argus-eyes for woman's weakness! How low, how
      irretrievably low must I have fallen when such a creature has power to
      fathom me!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LADY MILFORD, SOPHIA, a SERVANT.
</pre>
    <p>
      SERVANT (entering). Ma'mselle Miller waits.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (to SOPHIA). Hence with you! Leave the room instantly!
      (Imperiously, as the latter hesitates.) Must I repeat my orders? (SOPHIA
      retires&mdash;LADY MILFORD takes a few turns hastily.) So; 'tis well that
      I have been excited! I am in the fitter mood for this meeting. (To the
      SERVANT.) Let her approach.
    </p>

   [Exit SERVANT. LADY MILFORD throws herself upon the sofa,
   and assumes a negligent but studied attitude.

      SCENE VII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LADY MILFORD, LOUISA.

   LOUISA enters timidly, and remains standing at a great distance
   from LADY MILFORD, who has turned her back towards her, and for
   some time watches her attentively in the opposite looking-glass.
   After a pause&mdash;&mdash;-
</pre>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Noble lady, I await your commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (turning towards LOUISA, and making a slight and distant
      motion with her head.) Oh! Are you there? I presume the young lady&mdash;a
      certain&mdash;&mdash;. Pray what is your name?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (somewhat sensitively). My father's name is Miller. Your ladyship
      expressed a wish to see his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. True, true! I remember. The poor musician's daughter, of
      whom we were speaking the other day. (Aside, after a pause.) Very
      interesting, but no beauty! (To LOUISA.) Come nearer, my child. (Again
      aside.) Eyes well practised in weeping. Oh! How I love those eyes!
      (Aloud.) Nearer&mdash;come nearer! Quite close! I really think, my good
      child, that you are afraid of me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with firmness and dignity). No, my lady&mdash;I despise the
      opinion of the multitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (aside). Well, to be sure! She has learnt this boldness from
      him. (To LOUISA.) You have been recommended to me, miss! I am told that
      you have been decently educated, and are well disposed. I can readily
      believe it; besides, I would not, for the world, doubt the word of so warm
      an advocate.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. And yet I remember no one, my lady, who would be at the trouble to
      seek your ladyship's patronage for me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (significantly). Does that imply my unworthiness, or your
      humility?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Your words are beyond my comprehension, lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. More cunning than I should have expected from that open
      countenance. (To LOUISA.) Your name is Louisa, I believe? May I inquire
      your age?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Sixteen, just turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (starting up). Ha! There it is! Sixteen! The first pulsation
      of love! The first sweet vibration upon the yet unsounded harp! Nothing is
      more fascinating. (To LOUISA.) Be seated, lovely girl&mdash;I am anxious
      about you. (To herself.) And he, too, loves for the first time! What
      wonder, if the ruddy morning beams should meet and blend? (To LOUISA,
      taking her hand affectionately.) 'Tis settled: I will make your fortune.
      (To herself.) Oh! there is nothing in it: nothing, but the sweet transient
      vision of youth! (To LOUISA, patting her on the cheek.) My Sophy is on the
      point of leaving me to be married: you shall have her place. But just
      sixteen? Oh! it can never last.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (kissing her hand respectfully). Receive my thanks, lady, for your
      intended favors, and believe me not the less grateful though I may decline
      to accept them.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (relapsing into disdain and anger). Only hear the great lady!
      Girls of your station generally think themselves fortunate to obtain such
      promotion. What is your dependence, my dainty one? Are these fingers too
      delicate for work?&mdash;or is it your pretty baby-face that makes you
      give yourself these airs?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. My face, lady, is as little of my own choice as my station!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Perhaps you believe that your beauty will last forever? Poor
      creature! Whoever put that into your head&mdash;be he who he may&mdash;has
      deceived both you and himself! The colors of those cheeks are not burnt in
      with fire: what your mirror passes off upon you as solid and enduring is
      but a slight tinselling, which, sooner or later, will rub off in the hands
      of the purchaser. What then, will you do?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Pity the purchaser, lady, who bought a diamond because it appeared
      to be set in gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (affecting not to hear her). A damsel of your age has ever
      two mirrors, the real one, and her admirer. The flattering complaisance of
      the latter counterbalances the rough honesty of the former. What the one
      proclaims frightful pock-marks, the other declares to be dimples that
      would adorn the Graces. The credulous maid believes only so much of the
      former as is confirmed by the latter, and hies from one to the other till
      she confounds their testimonies, and concludes by fancying them to be both
      of one opinion. Why do you stare at me so?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Pardon me, lady! I was just then pitying those gorgeous sparkling
      brilliants, which are unconscious that their possessor is so strenuous a
      foe to vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (reddening). No evasion, miss. Were it not that you depend
      upon personal attractions, what in the world could induce you to reject a
      situation, the only one where you can acquire polish of manners and divest
      yourself of your plebeian prejudices?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. And with them, I presume, my plebeian innocence!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Preposterous objection! The most dissolute libertine dares
      not to disrespect our sex, unless we ourselves encourage him by advances.
      Prove what you are; make manifest your virtue and honor, and I will
      guarantee your innocence from danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Of that, lady, permit me to entertain a doubt! The palaces of
      certain ladies are but too often made a theatre for the most unbridled
      licentiousness. Who will believe that a poor musician's daughter could
      have the heroism to plunge into the midst of contagion and yet preserve
      herself untainted? Who will believe that Lady Milford would perpetually
      hold a scorpion to her breast, and lavish her wealth to purchase the
      advantage of every moment feeling her cheeks dyed with the crimson blush
      of shame? I will be frank, lady!&mdash;while I adorned you for some
      assignation, could you meet my eye unabashed? Could you endure my glance
      when you returned? Oh! better, far better, would it be that oceans should
      roll between us&mdash;that we should inhabit different climes! Beware, my
      lady!&mdash;hours of temperance, moments of satiety might intrude; the
      gnawing worm of remorse might plant its sting in your bosom, and then what
      a torment would it be for you to read in the countenance of your handmaid
      that calm serenity with which virtue ever rewards an uncorrupted heart!
      (Retiring a few steps.) Once more, gracious lady, I entreat your pardon!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (extremely agitated). Insupportable, that she should tell me
      this! Still more insupportable, that what she tells is true! (Turning to
      LOUISA, and looking at her steadfastly.) Girl! girl! this artifice does
      not blind me. Mere opinions do not speak out so warmly. Beneath the cloak
      of these sentiments lurks some far dearer interest. 'Tis that which makes
      my service particularly distasteful&mdash;which gives such energy to your
      language. (In a threatening voice.) What it is I am determined to
      discover.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (with calm dignity). And what if you do discover it? Suppose the
      contemptuous trampling of your foot should rouse the injured worm, which
      its Creator has furnished with a sting to protect it against misusage. I
      fear not your vengeance, lady! The poor criminal extended on the rack can
      look unappalled even on the dissolution of the world. My misery is so
      exquisite that even sincerity cannot draw down upon me any further
      infliction! (After a pause.) You say that you would raise me from the
      obscurity of my station. I will not examine the motives of this suspicious
      favor. I will only ask, what could induce you to think me so foolish as to
      blush at my station? What could induce you to become the architect of my
      happiness, before you knew whether I was willing to receive that happiness
      at your hands? I had forever renounced all claims upon the pleasures of
      the world. I had forgiven fortune that she had dealt with me so niggardly.
      Ah! why do you remind me of all this. If the Almighty himself hides his
      glory from the eyes of his creatures, lest the highest seraph should be
      overwhelmed by a sense of his own insignificance, why should mortals be so
      cruelly compassionate? Lady, lady! why is your vaunted happiness so
      anxious to excite the envy and wonder of the wretched? Does your bliss
      stand in need of the exhibition of despair for entertainment? Oh! rather
      grant me that blindness which alone can reconcile me to my barbarous lot!
      The insect feels itself as happy in a drop of water as though that drop
      was a paradise: so happy, and so contented! till some one tells it of a
      world of water, where navies ride and whales disport themselves! But you
      wish to make me happy, say you? (After a pause, she advances towards LADY
      MILFORD, and asks her suddenly.) Are you happy, lady? (LADY MILFORD turns
      from her hastily, and overpowered. LOUISA follows her, and lays her hand
      upon her bosom.) Does this heart wear the smile of its station? Could we
      now exchange breast for breast, and fate for fate&mdash;were I, in
      childlike innocence, to ask you on your conscience&mdash;were I to ask you
      as a mother&mdash; would you really counsel me to make the exchange?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (greatly excited, throwing herself on the sofa). Intolerable!
      Incomprehensible! No, Louisa, no! This greatness of thought is not your
      own, and your conceptions are too fiery, too full of youth, to be inspired
      by your father. Deceive me not! I detect another teacher&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (looking piercingly at her). I cannot but wonder, my lady, that you
      should have only just discovered that other teacher, and yet have
      previously shown so much anxiety to patronize me!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (starting up). 'Tis not to be borne! Well, then, since I
      cannot escape you, I know him&mdash;know everything&mdash;know more than I
      wish to know! (Suddenly restraining herself, then continuing with a
      violence which by degrees increases to frenzy.) But dare, unhappy one!&mdash;dare
      but still to love, or be beloved by him! What did I say? Dare but to think
      of him, or to be one of his thoughts! I am powerful, unhappy one!&mdash;
      dreadful in my vengeance! As sure as there is a God in heaven thou art
      lost forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (undaunted). Past all redemption, my lady, the moment you succeed
      in compelling him to love you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. I understand you&mdash;but I care not for his love! I will
      conquer this disgraceful passion. I will torture my own heart; but thine
      will I crush to atoms! Rocks and chasms will I hurl between you. I will
      rush, like a fury, into the heaven of your joys. My name shall affright
      your loves as a spectre scares an assassin. That young and blooming form
      in his embrace shall wither to a skeleton. I cannot be blest with him&mdash;
      neither shalt thou. Know, wretched girl; that to blast the happiness of
      others is in itself a happiness!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. A happiness, my lady, which is already beyond your reach! Seek not
      to deceive your own heart! You are incapable of executing what you
      threaten! You are incapable of torturing a being who has done you no wrong&mdash;but
      whose misfortune it is that her feelings have been sensible to impressions
      like your own. But I love you for these transports, my lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (recovering herself). Where am I? What have I done? What
      sentiments have I betrayed? To whom have I betrayed them? Oh, Louisa,
      noble, great, divine soul, forgive the ravings of a maniac! Fear not, my
      child! I will not injure a hair of thy head! Name thy wishes! Ask what
      thou wilt! I will serve thee with all my power; I will be thy friend&mdash;
      thy sister! Thou art poor; look (taking off her brilliants), I will sell
      these jewels&mdash;sell my wardrobe&mdash;my carriages and horses&mdash;all
      shall be thine&mdash;grant me but Ferdinand!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (draws back indignantly). Does she mock my despair?&mdash;or is she
      really innocent of participation in that cruel deed? Ha! then I may yet
      assume the heroine, and make my surrender of him pass for a sacrifice!
      (Remains for a while absorbed in thought, then approaches LADY MILFORD,
      seizes her hand, and gazes on her with a fixed and significant look.) Take
      him, lady! I here voluntarily resign the man whom hellish arts have torn
      from my bleeding bosom! Perchance you know it not, my lady! but you have
      destroyed the paradise of two lovers; you have torn asunder two hearts
      which God had linked together; you have crushed a creature not less dear
      to him than yourself, and no less created for happiness; one by whom he
      was worshipped as sincerely as by you; but who, henceforth, will worship
      him no more. But the Almighty is ever open to receive the last groan of
      the trampled worm. He will not look on with indifference when creatures in
      his keeping are murdered. Now Ferdinand is yours. Take him, lady, take
      him! Rush into his arms! Drag him with you to the altar! But forget not
      that the spectre of a suicide will rush between you and the bridal kiss.
      God be merciful! No choice is left me! (Rushes out of the chamber.)

   LADY MILFORD alone, in extreme agitation, gazing on the door by

</pre>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. What was that? What preys so on my heart? What said the
      unhappy one? Still, O heaven, the dreadful, damning words ring in my ears!
      "Take him! Take him!" What should I take, unfortunate? the bequest of your
      dying groan&mdash;the fearful legacy of your despair? Gracious heaven! am
      I then fallen so low? Am I so suddenly hurled from the towering throne of
      my pride that I greedily await what a beggar's generosity may throw me in
      the last struggle of death? "Take him! Take him!" And with what a tone was
      it uttered!&mdash;with what a look! What! Amelia! is it for this thou hast
      overleaped the bounds of thy sex? For this didst thou vaunt the glorious
      title of a free-born Briton, that thy boasted edifice of honor might sink
      before the nobler soul of a despised and lowly maiden? No, proud
      unfortunate! No! Amelia Milford may blush for shame,&mdash;but shall never
      be despised. I, too, have courage to resign. (She walks a few paces with a
      majestic gait.) Hide thyself, weak, suffering woman! Hence, ye sweet and
      golden dreams of love! Magnanimity alone be now my guide. These lovers are
      lost, or Amelia must withdraw her claim, and renounce the prince's heart.
      (After a pause, with animation.) It is determined! The dreadful obstacle
      is removed&mdash;broken are the bonds which bound me to the duke&mdash;torn
      from my bosom this raging passion. Virtue, into thy arms I throw myself.
      Receive thy repentant daughter. Ha! how happy do I feel! How suddenly
      relieved my heart, and how exalted! Glorious as the setting sun, will I
      this day descend from the pinnacle of my greatness; my grandeur shall
      expire with my love, and my own heart be the only sharer of my proud
      exile! (Going to her writing-table with a determined air.) It must be done
      at once&mdash;now, on the spot&mdash;before the recollection of Ferdinand
      renews the cruel conflict in my bosom! (She seats herself, and begins to

   LADY MILFORD, an ATTENDANT, SOPHIA, afterwards the MARSHAL,

</pre>
    <p>
      SERVANT. Marshal von Kalb is in the ante-chamber, and brings a message
      from his highness.

    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (not hearing him in the eagerness of writing). How the
      illustrious puppet will stare! The idea is singular enough, I own, the
      presuming to astonish his serene numskull. In what confusion will his
      court be thrown! The whole country will be in a ferment.
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANT and SOPHIA. Marshal von Kalb, my lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (turning round). Who? the marshal? So much the better! Such
      creatures were designed by nature to carry the ass' panniers.

    <p>
      SOPHIA (approaching anxiously). If I were not fearful, my lady, that you
      would think it presumption. (LADY MILFORD continuing to write eagerly.)
      Louisa Miller rushed madly to the hall&mdash;you are agitated&mdash;you
      speak to yourself. (LADY MILFORD continues writing.) I am quite alarmed.
      What can have happened? (The MARSHAL enters, making repeated bows at LADY
      MILFORD'S back; as she takes no notice of him, he comes nearer, stands
      behind her chair, touches the hem of her dress, and imprints a kiss on it,
      saying in a tremulous voice.) His serene highness&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (while she peruses hastily what she has written). He will tax
      me with black ingratitude! "I was poor and forsaken! He raised me from
      misery! From misery." Detestable exchange! Annul my bond, seducer! The
      blush of my eternal shame repays my debt with interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (after endeavoring in vain to catch her eye). Your ladyship seems
      somewhat absent. I take the liberty of permitting myself the boldness
      (very loud)&mdash;his serene highness, my lady, has sent me to inquire
      whether you mean to honor this evening's gala with your presence, or the
      theatre?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (rising, with a laugh). One or the other, sweet sir. In the
      meantime take this paper to your duke for his dessert. (To SOPHIA.) Do
      you, Sophia, give directions to have my carriage brought to the door
      without delay, and call my whole household together in this saloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOPHIA (goes out in great astonishment). Heavens! What do I forebode? What
      will this end in?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. You seem excited, my lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. The greater the chance of my letting you into a little
      truth. Rejoice, my Lord Marshal! There is a place vacant at court. A fine
      time for panders. (As the MARSHAL throws a look of suspicion upon the
      paper.) Read it, read it! 'Tis my desire that the contents should be made
      public. (While he reads it, the domestics enter, and range themselves in
      the background.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (reading). "Your highness&mdash;an engagement, broken by you so
      lightly, can no longer be binding on me. The happiness of your subjects
      was the condition of my love. For three years the deception has lasted.
      The veil at length falls from my eyes! I look with disgust on favors which
      are stained with the tears of your subjects. Bestow the love which I can
      no longer accept upon your weeping country, and learn from a British
      princess compassion to your German people. Within an hour I shall have
      quitted your dominions. JOANNA NORFOLK"
    </p>
    <p>
      SERVANTS (exclaiming to each other in astonishment). Quitted the
      dominions!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (replaces the letter upon the table in terror). God forbid, my
      dear and most excellent lady! The bearer of such a letter would be as mad
      as the writer!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. That is your concern, you pink of a courtier! Alas! I am
      sorry to know that you, and such as you, would choke even in the utterance
      of what others dare to do. My advice is that you bake the letter in a
      venison pasty, so that his most serene highness may find it on his plate!
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL. God preserve me! What presumption! Ponder well, I entreat you.
      Reflect on the disgrace which you will bring down upon yourself, my lady!
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD (turning to the assembled domestics, and addressing them in
      the deepest emotion). You seem amazed, good people; and anxiously awaiting
      the solution of this riddle? Draw nearer, my friends! You have served me
      truly and affectionately; have looked into my eyes rather than my purse.
      My pleasure was your study, my approbation your pride! Woe is me, that the
      remembrance of your fidelity must be the record of my unworthiness!
      Unhappy fate, that the darkest season of my life should have been the
      brightest of yours! (Her eyes suffused with tears.) We must part, my
      children. Lady Milford has ceased to exist, and Joanna of Norfolk is too
      poor to repay your love. What little wealth I have my treasurer will share
      among you. This palace belongs to the duke. The poorest of you will quit
      it far richer than his mistress! Farewell, my children! (She extends her
      hand, which they all in turn kiss, with marks of sorrow and affection.) I
      understand you, my good people! Farewell! forever farewell! (Struggling
      with her feelings.) I hear the carriage at the door. (She tears herself
      away, and is hurrying out when the MARSHAL arrests her progress.) How,
      now? Pitiful creature, art thou still there?
    </p>
    <p>
      MARSHAL (who all this while has been gazing in vacant astonishment at the
      letter). And must I be the person to put this letter into the most august
      hands of his most serene highness?
    </p>
    <p>
      LADY MILFORD. Pitiful creature, even thou! Thou must deliver into his most
      august hands, and convey to his most august ears, that, as I cannot go
      barefoot to Loretto, I will support myself by the labor of my hands, that
      I may be purified from the disgrace of having condescended to rule him.
      (She hurries off&mdash;the rest silently disperse.)

      SCENE I.&mdash;Twilight; a room in MILLER'S house.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   LOUISA sits silent and motionless in a dark corner of the room,
   her head reclining upon her hand. After a long pause, MILLER
   enters with a lantern, the light of which he casts anxiously
   round the chamber, without observing LOUISA, he then puts his
   hat on the table, and sets down the lantern.

   LOUISA, MILLER.
</pre>
    <p>
      MILLER. She is not here either. No, she is not here! I have wandered
      through every street; I have sought her with every acquaintance; I have
      inquired at every door! No one has seen my child! (A silence of some
      moments.) Patience, poor unhappy father! Patience till morning; then
      perhaps the corpse of your only one may come floating to shore. Oh, God in
      heaven! What though my heart has hung too idolatrously upon this daughter,
      yet surely the punishment is severe! Heavenly Father! Surely it is severe!
      I will not murmur, Heavenly Father; but the punishment is indeed severe!
      (Throws himself sorrowfully into a chair.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (without moving from her seat). Thou dost well, wretched old man!
      Learn betimes to lose.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (starts up eagerly). Ah! art thou there, my child? Art thou there?
      But wherefore thus alone, and without a light?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Yet am I not alone. When all things around me are dark and gloomy
      then have I the companionship which most I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. God defend thee, my child! The worm of conscience alone wakes and
      watches with the owl; none shun the light but criminals and evil spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. And eternity, father, which speaks to the soul in solitude!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Louisa, my child! What words are these?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (rises, and comes forward). I have fought a hard fight&mdash;you
      know it, father! but God gave me the strength! The fight is over! Father,
      our sex is called timid and weak; believe it no more! We tremble at a
      spider, but the black monster, corruption, we hug to our arms in sport!
      This for your edification, father. Your Louisa is merry.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. I had rather you wept. It would, please me better.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. How I will outwit him, father! How I shall cheat the tyrant! Love
      is more crafty than malice, and bolder&mdash;he knew not that, the man of
      the unlucky star! Oh! they are cunning so long as they have but to do with
      the head; but when they have to grapple with the heart the villains are at
      fault. He thought to seal his treachery with an oath! Oaths, father, may
      bind the living, but death dissolves even the iron bonds of the sacrament!
      Ferdinand will learn to know his Louisa. Father, will you deliver this
      letter for me? Will you do me the kindness?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. To whom, my child?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Strange question! Infinitude and my heart together had not space
      enough for a single thought but of him. To whom else should I write?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (anxiously). Hear me, Louisa! I must read this letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. As you please, father! but you will not understand it. The
      characters lie there like inanimate corpses, and live but for the eye of
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (reading). "You are betrayed, Ferdinand! An unparalleled piece of
      villany has dissolved the union of our hearts; but a dreadful vow binds my
      tongue, and your father has spies stationed upon every side. But, if thou
      hast courage, my beloved, I know a place where oaths no longer bind, and
      where spies cannot enter." (MILLER stops short, and gazes upon her
      steadfastly.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Why that earnest look, father? Read what follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. "But thou must be fearless enough to wander through a gloomy path
      with no other guides than God and thy Louisa. Thou must have no companion
      but love; leave behind all thy hopes, all thy tumultuous wishes&mdash;thou
      wilt need nothing on this journey but thy heart. Darest thou come; then
      set out as the bell tolls twelve from the Carmelite Tower. Dost thou fear;
      then erase from the vocabulary of thy sex's virtues the word courage, for
      a maiden will have put thee to shame." (MILLER lays down the letter and
      fixes his eyes upon the ground in deep sorrow. At length he turns to
      LOUISA, and says, in a low, broken voice) Daughter, where is that place?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Don't you know it, father? Do you really not know it? 'Tis
      strange! I have described it unmistakably! Ferdinand will not fail to find
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Pray speak plainer!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I can think of no pleasing name for it just now! You must not be
      alarmed, father, if the name I give it has a terrible sound. That place,&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
      why has no lover invented a name for it! He would have chosen the softest,
      the sweetest&mdash;that place, my dear father&mdash;but you must not
      interrupt me&mdash;that place is&mdash;the grave!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (staggering to a seat). Oh, God!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (hastens to him, and supports him). Nay, father, be not alarmed!
      These are but terrors which hover round an empty word! Take away the name
      and the grave will seem to be a bridal-bed over which Aurora spreads her
      golden canopy and spring strews her fairest flowers. None but a groaning
      sinner pictures death as a skeleton; to others he is a gentle, smiling
      boy, blooming as the god of love, but not so false&mdash;a silent,
      ministering spirit who guides the exhausted pilgrim through the desert of
      eternity, unlocks for him the fairy palace of everlasting joy, invites him
      in with friendly smiles, and vanishes forever!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. What meanest thou, my child? Surely, thou wilt not lay guilty
      hands on thine own life?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Speak not thus, father! To quit a community from which I am
      already rejected, to fly voluntarily to a place from which I cannot much
      longer be absent, is that a sin?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Suicide is the most horrible of sins, my child. 'Tis the only one
      that can never he repented, since death arrives at the moment the crime is
      committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (stands motionless with horror). That is dreadful! But my death
      will not be so sudden, father. I will spring into the river, and while the
      waters are closing over me, cry to the Almighty for mercy and forgiveness!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. That is to say, you will repent the theft as soon as the treasure
      is secure! Daughter! Daughter! beware how you mock your God when you most
      need his help! Oh! you have gone far, far astray! You have forgotten the
      worship of your Creator, and he has withdrawn his protecting hand from
      you!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Is it, then, a crime to love, father?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. So long as thou lovest God thou wilt never love man to idolatry.
      Thou hast bowed me down low, my only one! low! very low! perhaps to the
      grave! Yet will I not increase the sadness of thy heart. Daughter! I gave
      vent to my feelings as I entered. I thought myself alone! Thou hast
      overheard me! and why should I longer conceal the truth. Thou wert my
      idol! Hear me, Louisa, if there is yet room in thy heart for a father's
      feelings. Thou wert my all! Of thine own thou hast nothing more to lose,
      but I have my all at stake! My life depends on thee! My hairs are turning
      gray, Louisa; they show that the time is drawing nigh with me when fathers
      look for a return of the capital invested in the hearts of their children.
      Wilt thou defraud me of this, Louisa? Wilt thou away and bear with thee
      all the wealth of thy father?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (kissing his hand in the deepest emotion). No, father, no! I go
      from this world deeply in your debt, and will repay you with usury in the
      world to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Beware, my child, lest thy reckoning should be false! (very
      earnestly and solemnly). Art thou certain that we shall meet in that world
      to come? Lo! how the color fades from thy cheek! My child must feel that I
      can scarcely overtake her in that other world if she hurries there before
      me. (LOUISA throws herself shuddering into his arms, he clasps her warmly
      to his bosom, and continues in a tone of fervent adjuration.) Oh! Louisa!
      Louisa! Fallen, perhaps already lost, daughter! Treasure in thy heart the
      solemn counsels of a father! I cannot eternally watch over thee! I may
      snatch the dagger from thy hands; but thou canst let out life with a
      bodkin. I may remove poison from thy reach; but thou canst strangle
      thyself with a necklace. Louisa! Louisa! I can only warn thee. Wilt thou
      rush boldly forward till the perfidious phantom which lured thee on
      vanishes at the awful brink of eternity? Wilt thou dare approach the
      throne of the Omniscient with the lie on thy lips? "At thy call am I here,
      Creator!" while thy guilty eyes are in search only of their mortal idol!
      And when thou shalt see this perishable god of thine own creation, a worm
      like thee, writhing at the Almighty's feet; when thou shalt hear him in
      the awful moment give the lie to thy guilty daring, and blast thy delusive
      hopes of eternal mercy, which the wretch implores in vain for himself;
      what then! (Louder and more fervently), What, then, unhappy one? (He
      clasps her still closer to his bosom, and gazes upon her with wild and
      piercing looks; then suddenly disengages himself.) I can do no more!
      (Raising his right hand towards heaven.) Immortal Judge, I can do no more
      to save this soul from ruin! Louisa, do what thou wilt. Offer up a
      sacrifice at the altar of this idolized youth that shall make thy evil
      genius howl for transport and thy good angels forsake thee in despair. Go
      on! Heap sin upon sin,&mdash;add to them this, the last, the heaviest,&mdash;and,
      if the scale be still too light throw in my curse to complete the measure.
      Here is a knife; pierce thy own heart, and (weeping aloud and rushing
      away), and with it, thy father's!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (following and detaining him). Stay! stay! Oh! father, father!&mdash;
      to think that affection should wound more cruelly than a tyrant's rage!
      What shall I?&mdash;I cannot!&mdash;what must I do?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. If thy lover's kisses burn hotter than thy father's tears&mdash;then
      die!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (after a violent internal struggle, firmly). Father! Here is my
      hand! I will&mdash;God! God! what am I doing! What would I?&mdash;father,
      I swear. Woe is me! Criminal that I am where'er I turn! Father, be it so!
      Ferdinand. God, look down upon the act! Thus I destroy the last memorial
      of him. (Tearing the letter.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (throwing himself in ecstasy upon her neck). There spoke my
      daughter! Look up, my child! Thou hast lost a lover, but thou hast made a
      father happy. (Embracing her, and alternately laughing and crying.) My
      child! my child! I was not worthy to live so blest a moment! God knows how
      I, poor miserable sinner, became possessed of such an angel! My Louisa! My
      paradise! Oh! I know but little of love; but that to rend its bonds must
      be a bitter grief I can well believe!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. But let us hasten from this place, my father! Let us fly from the
      city, where my companions scoff at me, and my good name is lost forever&mdash;let
      us away, far away, from a spot where every object tells of my ruined
      happiness,&mdash;let us fly if it be possible!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Whither thou wilt, my daughter! The bread of the Lord grows
      everywhere, and He will grant ears to listen to my music. Yes! we will fly
      and leave all behind. I will set the story of your sorrows to the lute,
      and sing of the daughter who rent her own heart to preserve her father's.
      We will beg with the ballad from door to door, and sweet will be the alms
      bestowed by the hand of weeping sympathy!

      SCENE II.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   The former; FERDINAND.
</pre>
    <p>
      LOUISA (who perceives him first, throws herself shrieking into MILLER'S
      arms). God! There he is! I am lost!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Who? Where?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (points, with averted face, to the MAJOR, and presses closer to her
      father). 'Tis he! 'Tis he! himself! Look round, father, look round!&mdash;he
      comes to murder me!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (perceives him and starts back). How, baron? You here?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (approaches slowly, stands opposite to LOUISA, and fixes a stern
      and piercing look upon her. After a pause, he says). Stricken conscience,
      I thank thee! Thy confession is dreadful, but swift and true, and spares
      me the torment of an explanation! Good evening, Miller!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. For God's sake! baron, what seek you? What brings you hither? What
      means this surprise?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I knew a time when the day was divided into seconds, when
      eagerness for my presence hung upon the weights of the tardy clock, and
      when every pulse-throb was counted until the moment of my coming. How is
      it that I now surprise?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Oh, leave us, leave us, baron! If but one spark of humanity still
      linger in your bosom;&mdash;if you seek not utterly to destroy her whom
      you profess to love, fly from this house, stay not one moment longer. The
      blessing of God deserted us when your foot first crossed its threshold.
      You have brought misery under a roof where all before was joy and
      happiness. Are you not yet content? Do you seek to deepen the wound which
      your fatal passion has planted in the heart of my only child?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Strange father, I have come to bring joyful tidings to your
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Perchance fresh hopes, to add to her despair. Away, away, thou
      messenger of ill! Thy looks belie thy words.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. At length the goal of my hopes appears in view! Lady Milford,
      the most fearful obstacle to our love, has this moment fled the land. My
      father sanctions my choice. Fate grows weary of persecuting us, and our
      propitious stars now blaze in the ascendant&mdash;I am come to fulfil my
      plighted troth, and to lead my bride to the altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Dost thou hear him, my child? Dost thou hear him mock at thy
      cheated hopes? Oh, truly, baron! It is so worthy of the deceiver to make a
      jest of his own crime!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You think I am jesting? By my honor I am not! My protestations
      are as true as the love of my Louisa, and I will keep them as sacred as
      she has kept her oaths. Nothing to me is more sacred. Can you still doubt?
      Still no joyful blush upon the cheek of my fair bride? 'Tis strange!
      Falsehood must needs be here the current coin, since truth finds so little
      credit. You mistrust my words, it seems? Then read this written testimony.
      (He throws LOUISA her letter to the MARSHAL. She opens it, and sinks upon
      the floor pale as death.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (not observing this). What can this mean, baron? I do not
      understand you.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. (leads him to LOUISA). But your daughter has understood me
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (throws himself on his knees beside her). Oh, God! my child!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Pale as a corpse! 'Tis thus your daughter pleases me the best.
      Your demure and virtuous daughter was never half so lovely as with that
      deathlike paleness. The blast of the day of judgment, which strips the
      varnish from every lie, has wafted the painted colors from her cheek, or
      the juggler might have cheated even the angels of light. This is her
      fairest countenance. Now for the first time do I see it in its truth. Let
      me kiss it. (He approaches her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Back! Away, boy! Trifle not with a father's feelings. I could not
      defend her from your caresses, but I can from your insults.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. What wouldst thou, old man? With thee I have naught to do.
      Engage not in a game so irrevocably lost. Or hast thou, too, been wiser
      than I thought? Hast thou employed the wisdom of thy sixty years in
      pandering to thy daughter's amours, and disgraced those hoary locks with
      the office of a pimp? Oh! if it be not so, wretched old man, then lay
      thyself down and die. There is still time. Thou mayest breathe by last in
      the sweet delusion, "I was a happy father!" Wait but a moment longer and
      thine own hand will dash to her infernal home this poisonous viper; thou
      wilt curse the gift, and him who gave it, and sink to the grave in
      blasphemy and despair. (To LOUISA.) Speak, wretched one, speak! Didst thou
      write this letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (to LOUISA, impressively). For God's sake, daughter, forget not!
      forget not!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Oh, father&mdash;that letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Oh! that it should have fallen into the wrong hands. Now
      blessed be the accident! It has effected more than the most consummate
      prudence, and will at the day of judgment avail more than the united
      wisdom of sages. Accident, did I say? Oh! Providence directs, when a
      sparrow falls, why not when a devil is unmasked? But I will be answered!
      Didst thou write that letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (to LOUISA, in a tone of entreaty). Be firm, my child, be firm! But
      a single "Yes," and all will be over.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Excellent! excellent! The father, too, is deceived! All, all
      are deceived by her! Look, how the perfidious one stands there; even her
      tongue refuses participation in her last lie. I adjure thee by that God so
      terrible and true&mdash;didst thou write that letter?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (after a painful struggle, with firmness and decision). I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (stands aghast). No! As my soul liveth, thou hast lied. Even
      innocence itself, when extended on the rack, confesses crime which it
      never committed&mdash;I ask too passionately. Is it not so, Louisa? Thou
      didst but confess, because I asked passionately?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I confessed the truth!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. No, I tell thee! No! no! Thou didst not write that letter! It
      is not like thy hand! And, even though it were, why should it be more
      difficult to counterfeit a writing than to undo a heart? Tell me truly,
      Louisa! Yet no, no, do not! Thou mightest say yes again, and then I were
      lost forever. A lie, Louisa! A lie! Oh! if thou didst but know one now&mdash;if
      thou wouldst utter it with that open angelic mien&mdash;if thou wouldst
      but persuade mine ear and eye, though it should deceive my heart ever so
      monstrously! Oh, Louisa! Then might truth depart in the same breath&mdash;depart
      from our creation, and the sacred cause itself henceforth bow her stiff
      neck to the courtly arts of deception.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. By the Almighty God! by Him who is so terrible and true! I did!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (after a pause, with the expression of the most heartfelt
      sorrow). Woman! Woman! With what a face thou standest now before me! Offer
      Paradise with that look, and even in the regions of the damned thou wilt
      find no purchaser. Didst thou know what thou wert to me, Louisa?
      Impossible! No! thou knewest not that thou wert my all&mdash;all! 'Tis a
      poor insignificant word! but eternity itself can scarcely circumscribe it.
      Within it systems of worlds can roll their mighty orbs. All! and to sport
      with it so wickedly. Oh, 'tis horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Baron von Walter, you have heard my confession! I have pronounced
      my own condemnation! Now go! Fly from a house where you have been so
      unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. 'Tis well! 'tis well! You see I am calm; calm, too, they say,
      is the shuddering land through which the plague has swept. I am calm. Yet
      ere I go, Louisa, one more request! It shall be my last. My brain burns
      with fever! I need refreshment! Will you make me some lemonade?

   FERDINAND and MILLER.

   They both pace up and down without speaking, on opposite sides
   of the room, for some minutes.
</pre>
    <p>
      MILLER (standing still at length, and regarding the MAJOR with a sorrowful
      air). Dear baron, perhaps it may alleviate your distress to say that I
      feel for you most deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Enough of this, Miller. (Silence again for some moments.)
      Miller, I forget what first brought me to your house. What was the
      occasion of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. How, baron? Don't you remember? You came to take lessons on the
      flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (suddenly). And I beheld his daughter! (Another pause.) You have
      not kept your faith with me, friend! You were to provide me with repose
      for my leisure hours; but you betrayed me and sold me scorpions.
      (Observing MILLER'S agitation.) Tremble not, good old man! (falling deeply
      affected on his neck)&mdash;the fault was none of thine!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (wiping his eyes). Heaven knows, it was not!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (traversing the room, plunged in the most gloomy meditation).
      Strange! Oh! beyond conception strange, are the Almighty's dealings with
      us! How often do terrific weights hang upon slender, almost invisible
      threads! Did man but know that he should eat death in a particular apple!
      Hem! Could he but know that! (He walks a few more turns; then stops
      suddenly, and grasps MILLER'S hand with strong emotion.) Friend, I have
      paid dearly for thy lessons&mdash;and thou, too, hast been no gainer&mdash;
      perhaps mayst even lose thy all. (Quitting him dejectedly.) Unhappy
      flute-playing, would that it never entered my brain!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (striving to repress his feelings). The lemonade is long in coming.
      I will inquire after it, if you will excuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. No hurry, dear Miller! (Muttering to himself.) At least to her
      father there is none. Stay here a moment. What was I about to ask you? Ay,
      I remember! Is Louisa your only daughter? Have you no other child?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (warmly). I have no other, baron, and I wish for no other. That
      child is my only solace in this world, and on her have I embarked my whole
      stock of affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (much agitated). Ha! Pray see for the drink, good Miller!

    <p>
      FERDINAND. His only child! Dost thou feel that, murderer? His only one!
      Murderer, didst thou hear, his only one? The man has nothing in God's wide
      world but his instrument and that only daughter! And wilt thou rob him of
      her?

      Rob him? Rob a beggar of his last pittance? Break the lame man's crutch,

      when he hastens home, impatient to reckon in his daughter's smiles the
      whole sum of his happiness; and when he enters the chamber, and there lies
      the rose&mdash;withered&mdash;dead&mdash;crushed&mdash;his last, his only,
      his sustaining hope. Ha! And when he stands before her, and all nature
      looks on in breathless horror, while his vacant eye wanders hopelessly
      through the gloom of futurity, and seeks God, but finds him nowhere, and
      then returns disappointed and despairing! Great God! and has not my
      father, too, an only son? an only child, but not his only treasure. (After
      a pause.) Yet stay! What will the old man lose? She who could wantonly
      jest with the most sacred feelings of love, will she make a father happy?
      She cannot! She will not! And I deserve thanks for crushing this viper ere
      the parent feels its sting.

   MILLER returning, and FERDINAND.
</pre>
    <p>
      MILLER. You shall be served instantly, baron! The poor thing is sitting
      without, weeping as though her heart would break! Your drink will be
      mingled with her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. 'Twere well for her were it only with tears! We were speaking
      of my lessons, Miller. (Taking out a purse.) I remember that I am still in
      your debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. How? What? Go along with you, baron! What do you take me for?
      There is time enough for payment. Do not put such an affront on me; we are
      not together for the last time, please God.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Who can tell? Take your money. It is for life or death.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (laughing). Oh! for the matter of that, baron! As regards that I
      don't think I should run much risk with you!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You would run the greatest. Have you never heard that youths
      have died. That damsels and youths have died, the children of hope, the
      airy castles of their disappointed parents? What is safe from age and
      worms has often perished by a thunderbolt. Even your Louisa is not
      immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. God gave her to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Hear me! I say to you your Louisa is not immortal. That
      daughter is the apple of your eye; you hang upon her with your whole heart
      and soul. Be prudent, Miller! None but a desperate gamester stakes his all
      upon a single cast. The merchant would be called a madman who embarked his
      whole fortune in one ship. Think upon this, and remember that I warned
      you. But why do you not take your money?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. How, baron, how? All that enormous purse? What can you be thinking
      of?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Upon my debt! There! (Throws a heavy purse on the table; some
      gold drops out.) I cannot hold the dross to eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (astonished). Mercy on us! what is this? The sound was not of
      silver! (Goes to the table and cries out in astonishment.) In heaven's
      name, baron, what means this? What are you about? You must be out of your
      mind! (Clasping his hands.) There it lies! or I am bewitched. 'Tis
      damnable! I feel it now; the beauteous, shining, glorious heap of gold!
      No, Satan, thou shalt not catch my soul with this!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Have you drunk old wine, or new, Miller?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (violently). Death and furies! Look yourself, then. It is gold!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. And what of that?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER. Let me implore you, baron! In the name of all the saints in
      heaven, I entreat you! It is gold!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. An extraordinary thing, it must be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (after a pause; addressing him with emotion). Noble sir, I am a
      plain, straightforward man&mdash;do you wish to tempt me to some piece of
      knavery?&mdash;for, heaven knows, that so much gold cannot be got
      honestly!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (moved). Make yourself quite easy, dear Miller! You have well
      earned the money. God forbid that I should use it to the corruption of
      your conscience!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (jumping about like a madman). It is mine, then! Mine indeed! Mine
      with the knowledge and consent of God! (Hastening to the door.) Daughter,
      wife, hurrah, come hither! (Returning.) But, for heaven's sake, how have I
      all at once deserved this awful treasure? How am I to earn it? How repay
      it, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Not by your music lessons, Miller! With this gold do I pay you
      for (stops suddenly, and shudders)&mdash;I pay you&mdash;(after a pause,
      with emotion)&mdash;for my three months' unhappy dream of your daughter!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (taking his hand and pressing it affectionately). Most gracious
      sir! were you some poor and low-born citizen, and my daughter refused your
      love, I would pierce her heart with my own hands. (Returning to the gold
      in a sorrowful tone.) But then I shall have all, and you nothing&mdash;
      and I should have to give up all this glorious heap again, eh?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Let not that thought distress you, friend. I am about to quit
      this country, and in that to which I am journeying such coin is not
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (still fixing his eyes in transport on the money). Mine, then, it
      remains? Mine? Yet it grieves me that you are going to leave us. Only just
      wait a little and you shall see how I'll come out! I'll hold up my head
      with the best of them. (Puts on his hat with an air, and struts up and
      down the room.) I'll give my lessons in the great concert-room, and won't
      I smoke away at the best puyke varinas&mdash;and, when you catch me again
      fiddling at the penny-hop, may the devil take me!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Stay, Miller! Be silent, and gather up your gold.
      (Mysteriously.) Keep silence only for this one evening, and do me the
      favor henceforward to give no more music lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (still more vehemently grasping his hand, full of inward joy). And
      my daughter, baron! my daughter! (Letting go.) No, no! Money does not make
      the man&mdash;whether I feed on vegetables or on partridges, enough is
      enough, and this coat will do very well as long as the sunbeams don't peep
      in at the elbows. To me money is mere dross. But my girl shall benefit by
      the blessing; whatever wish I can read in her eyes shall be gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (suddenly interrupting him). Oh! silence! silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (still more warmly). And she shall learn to speak French like a
      born native, and to dance minuets, and to sing, so that people shall read
      of her in the newspapers; and she shall wear a cap like the judge's
      daughter, and a kidebarri [meaning, no doubt, Cul de Paris, a bustle], as
      they call it; and the fiddler's daughter shall be talked of for twenty
      miles round.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. (seizing his hand in extreme agitation). No more! no more! For
      God's sake be silent! Be silent but for this one night; 'tis the only
      favor I ask of you.

      MILLER. A thousand with pleasure! What are your commands?

    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (to MILLER, who is going). Stay&mdash;one thing more! Here is a
      letter to my father, which I received this evening enclosed in one to
      myself. Perhaps on business of importance. You may as well deliver it at
      the same time.

   LOUISA re-enters slowly with the light, places it on the table,

   the ground, except when she raises them to him with timid, stolen
   glances. He stands opposite, looking steadfastly on the earth&mdash;a
   long and deep silence.
</pre>
    <p>
      LOUISA. If you will accompany me, Baron von Walter, I will try a piece on
      the harpsichord! (She opens the instrument. FERDINAND makes no answer. A
      pause.)

      modesty&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I am quite aware that we are no longer fit companions. I confess
      that I was terrified when you sent away my father. I believe, Baron von
      Walter, that this moment is equally insupportable to us both. Permit me to
      ask some of my acquaintances to join us.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Yes, pray do so! And I too will go and invite some of mine.

    <p>
      LOUISA (looking at him with surprise). Baron von Walter!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (very spitefully). By my honor, the most fortunate idea that in
      our situation could ever enter mortal brain? Let us change this wearisome
      duet into sport and merriment, and by the aid of certain gallantries,
      revenge ourselves on the caprices of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. You are merry, Baron von Walter!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Oh! wonderfully so! The very street-boys would hunt me through
      the market-place for a merry-andrew! In fact, Louisa, your example has
      inspired me&mdash;you shall be my teacher. They are fools who prate of
      endless affection&mdash;never-ending sameness grows flat and insipid
      &mdash;variety alone gives zest to pleasure. Have with you, Louisa, we are
      now of one mind. We will skip from amour to amour, whirl from vice to
      vice; you in one direction, I in another. Perhaps I may recover my lost
      tranquillity in some brothel. Perhaps, when our merry race is run, and we
      become two mouldering skeletons, chance again may bring us together with
      the most pleasing surprise, and we may, as in a melodrama, recognize each
      other by a common feature of disease&mdash;that mother whom her children
      can never disavow. Then, perhaps, disgust and shame may create that union
      between us which could not be effected by the most tender love.

      then, canst thou judge of the feelings of others? Unhappy, did she say?&mdash;ha!
      that word would call my anger from the grave! She knew that I must become
      unhappy. Death and damnation! she knew it, and yet betrayed me! Look to
      it, serpent! That was thy only chance of forgiveness. This confession has
      condemned thee. Till now I thought to palliate thy crime with thy
      simplicity, and in my contempt thou hadst well nigh escaped my vengeance
      (seizing the glass hastily). Thou wert not thoughtless, then&mdash; thou
      wert not simple&mdash;thou wert nor more nor less than a devil! (He
      drinks.) The drink is bad, like thy soul! Taste it!

      melting eyes! they subdue me. Come to me, snake, in all thy monstrous

      proud coils to heaven! Stand before my eyes, hateful as the abyss of hell
      e'er saw thee! but not in that angel form! Take any shape but that! 'Tis
      too late. I must crush thee like a viper, or despair! Mercy on thy soul!

      LOUISA. Oh! that it should come to this!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (gazing on her). So fair a work of the heavenly artist! Who
      would believe it? Who can believe it? (Taking her hand and elevating it.)
      I will not arraign thy ordinations, oh! incomprehensible Creator! Yet
      wherefore didst thou pour thy poison into such beauteous vessels? Can
      crime inhabit so fair a region? Oh! 'tis strange! 'tis passing strange!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. To hear this, and yet be compelled to silence!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. And that soft, melodious voice! How can broken chords discourse
      such harmony? (Gazing rapturously upon her figure.) All so lovely! so full
      of symmetry! so divinely perfect! Throughout the whole such signs that
      'twas the favorite work of God! By heaven, as though all mankind had been
      created but to practise the Creator, ere he modelled this his masterpiece!
      And that the Almighty should have failed in the soul alone? Is it possible
      that this monstrous abortion of nature should have escaped as perfect?
      (Quitting her hastily.) Or did God see an angel's form rising beneath his
      chisel, and balance the error by giving her a heart wicked in proportion?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Alas for this criminal wilfulness! Rather than confess his own
      rashness, he accuses the wisdom of heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (falls upon her neck, weeping bitterly). Yet once more, my
      Louisa! Yet once again, as on the day of our first kiss, when you faltered
      forth the name of Ferdinand, and the first endearing "Thou!" trembled on
      thy burning lips. Oh! a harvest of endless and unutterable joys seemed to
      me at that moment to be budding forth. There lay eternity like a bright
      May-day before our eyes; thousands of golden years, fair as brides, danced
      around our souls. Then was I so happy! Oh! Louisa! Louisa! Louisa! Why
      hast thou used me thus?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Weep, Walter, weep! Your compassion will be more just towards me
      than your wrath.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. You deceive yourself. These are not nature's tears! not that
      warm delicious dew which flows like balsam on the wounded soul, and drives
      the chilled current of feeling swiftly along its course. They are solitary
      ice-cold drops! the awful, eternal farewell of my love! (With fearful
      solemnity, laying his hand on her head.) They are tears for thy soul,
      Louisa! tears for the Deity, whose inexhaustible beneficence has here
      missed its aim, and whose noblest work is cast away thus wantonly. Oh
      methinks the whole universe should clothe itself in black, and weep at the
      fearful example now passing in its centre. 'Tis but a common sorrow when
      mortals fall and Paradise is lost; but, when the plague extends its
      ravages to angels, then should there be wailing throughout the whole
      creation!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Drive me not to extremities, Walter. I have fortitude equal to
      most, but it must not be tried by a more than human test. Walter! one
      word, and then&mdash;we part forever. A dreadful fatality has deranged the
      language of our hearts. Dared I unclose these lips, Walter, I could tell
      thee things! I could&mdash;&mdash;But cruel fate has alike fettered my
      tongue and my heart, and I must endure in silence, even though you revile
      me as a common strumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Dost thou feel well, Louisa?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Why that question?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. It would grieve me shouldst thou be called hence with a lie
      upon thy lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I implore you, Walter&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in violent agitation). No! no! That revenge were too satanic!
      No! God forbid! I will not extend my anger beyond the grave! Louisa, didst
      thou love the marshal? Thou wilt leave this room no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (sitting down). Ask what you will. I shall give no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in a solemn voice). Take heed for thy immortal soul! Louisa!
      Didst thou love the marshal? Thou wilt leave this room no more!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I shall give no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (throwing himself on his knees before her in the deepest
      emotion). Louisa! Didst thou love the marshal? Before this light burns out&mdash;thou
      wilt stand&mdash;before the throne of God!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (starting from her seat in terror). Merciful Jesus! what was that?
      And I feel so ill! (She falls back into her chair.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Already? Oh, woman, thou eternal paradox! thy delicate nerves
      can sport with crimes at which manhood trembles; yet one poor grain of
      arsenic destroys them utterly!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Poison! poison! Oh! Almighty God!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. I fear it is so! Thy lemonade was seasoned in hell! Thou hast
      pledged death in the draught!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. To die! To die! All-merciful God! Poison in my drink! And to die!
      Oh! have mercy on my soul, thou Father in heaven!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Ay, be that thy chief concern: I will join thee in that prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. And my mother! My father, too! Saviour of the world! My poor
      forlorn father! Is there then no hope? And I so young, and yet no hope?
      And must I die so soon?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. There is no hope! None!&mdash;you are already doomed! But be
      calm. We shall journey together.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Thou too, Ferdinand? Poison, Ferdinand! From thee! Oh! God forgive
      him! God of mercy, lay not this crime on him!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Look to your own account. I fear it stands but ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. Ferdinand! Ferdinand! Oh! I can be no longer silent. Death&mdash;
      death absolves all oaths. Ferdinand! Heaven and earth contain nothing more
      unfortunate than thou! I die innocent, Ferdinand!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (terrified). Ah! What do I hear? Would she rush into the
      presence of her Maker with a lie on her lips?
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. I lie not! I do not lie! In my whole life I never lied but once!
      Ugh! what an icy shivering creeps through my veins! When I wrote that
      letter to the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. Ha! That letter! Blessed be to God! Now I am myself again!
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (her voice every moment becomes more indistinct. Her fingers
      tremble with a convulsive motion). That letter. Prepare yourself for a
      terrible disclosure! My hand wrote what my heart abhorred. It was dictated
      by your father! (Ferdinand stands like a statue petrified with horror.
      After a long silence, he falls upon the floor as if struck by lightning.)
      Oh! that sorrowful act!&mdash;&mdash;Ferdinand&mdash;I was compelled&mdash;
      forgive me&mdash;thy Louisa would have preferred death&mdash;but my father&mdash;his
      life in danger! They were so crafty in their villany.
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (starting furiously from the ground). God be thanked! The poison
      spares me yet! (He seizes his sword.)
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA (growing weaker by degrees). Alas! what would you? He is thy
      father!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in the most ungovernable fury). A murderer&mdash;the murderer
      of his son; he must along with us that the Judge of the world may pour his
      wrath on the guilty alone. (Hastening away).
    </p>
    <p>
      LOUISA. My dying Redeemer pardoned his murderers,&mdash;may God pardon
      thee and thy father! (She dies.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (turns quickly round, and perceives her in the convulsions of
      death, throws himself distractedly on the body). Stay! stay! Fly not from
      me, angel of light! (Takes her hand, but lets it fall again instantly.)
      Cold! cold and damp! her soul has flown! (Starting up suddenly.) God of my
      Louisa! Mercy! Mercy for the most accursed of murderers! Such was her
      dying prayer! How fair, how lovely even in death! The pitying destroyer
      has touched gently on those heavenly features. That sweetness was no mask&mdash;the
      hand of death even has not removed it! (After a pause.) But how is this?
      why do I feel nothing. Will the vigor of my youth save me? Thankless care!
      That shall it not. (He seizes the glass.)

      SCENE VIII.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   FERDINAND, the PRESIDENT, WORM, and SERVANTS, who all rush in alarm
   into the room. Afterwards MILLER, with a crowd, and OFFICERS of
   justice, who assemble in the background.
</pre>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (an open letter in his hand). My son! what means this? I never
      can believe&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (throwing the glass at his feet). Convince thyself, murderer!
      (The PRESIDENT staggers back. All stand speechless. A dreadful pause.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. My son! Why hast thou done this?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (without looking at him). Why, to be sure I ought first to have
      asked the statesman whether the trick suited his cards. Admirably fine and
      skilful, I confess, was the scheme of jealousy to break the bond of our
      hearts! The calculation shows a master-mind; 'twas pity only that
      indignant love would not move on wires like thy wooden puppets.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (looking round the circle with rolling eyes). Is there no one
      here who weeps for a despairing father?
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (calling behind the SCENEs). Let me in! For God's sake, let me in!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. She is now a saint in heaven! Her cause is in the hands of
      another! (He opens the door for MILLER, who rushes in, followed by
      officers of justice and a crowd of people.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (in the most dreadful alarm). My child! My child! Poison, they cry&mdash;poison
      has been here! My daughter! Where art thou?
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (leading him between the PRESIDENT and LOUISA'S corpse). I am
      innocent. Thank this man for the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (throwing himself on the body). Oh, Jesus!
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. In few words, father!&mdash;they begin to be precious to me. I
      have been robbed of my life by villanous artifice&mdash;robbed of it by
      you! How I may stand with God I tremble to think, but a deliberate villain
      I have never been! Be my final judgment what it will, may it not fall on
      thee! But I have committed murder! (In a loud and fearful voice.) A murder
      whose weight thou canst not hope that I should drag alone before the
      judgment-seat of God. Here I solemnly bequeath to thee the heaviest, the
      bloodiest part; how thou mayst answer it be that thy care! (Leading him to
      LOUISA.) Here, barbarian! Feast thine eyes on the terrible fruits of thy
      intrigues! Upon this face thy name is inscribed in the convulsions of
      death, and will be registered by the destroying angel! May a form like
      this draw thy curtain when thou sleepest, and grasp thee with its
      clay-cold hand! May a form like this flit before thy soul when thou diest,
      and drive away thy expiring prayer for mercy! May a form like this stand
      by thy grave at the resurrection, and before the throne of God when he
      pronounces thy doom! (He faints, the servants receive him in their arms.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (extending his arms convulsively towards heaven). Not from me,
      Judge of the world. Ask not these souls from me, but from him! (Pointing
      to WORM.)
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (starting). From me?
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT. Accursed villain, from thee! From thee, Satan! Thou gavest the
      serpent's counsel! thine be the responsibility; their blood be not on my
      head, but on thine!
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM. On mine! on mine! (laughing hysterically.) Oh! Excellent! Now I
      understand the gratitude of devils. On mine, thou senseless villain! Was
      he my son? Was I thy master? Mine the responsibility? Ha! by this sight
      which freezes the very marrow in my bones! Mine it shall be! I will brave
      destruction, but thou shalt perish with me. Away! away! Cry murder in the
      streets! Awaken justice! Bind me, officers! Lead me hence! I will discover
      secrets which shall make the hearer's blood run cold. (Going.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (detaining him). Surely, madman, thou wilt not dare?
    </p>
    <p>
      WORM (tapping him on the shoulder). I will, though,&mdash;comrade, I will!
      I am mad, 'tis true; but my madness is thy work, and now I will act like a
      madman! Arm in arm with thee will I to the scaffold! Arm in arm with thee
      to hell! Oh! how it tickles my fancy, villain, to be damned with thee!
      (The officers carry him off.)
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLER (who has lain upon LOUISA'S corpse in silent anguish, starts
      suddenly up, and throws the purse before the MAJOR'S feet.) Poisoner, take
      back thy accursed gold! Didst thou think to purchase my child with it?
      (Rushes distractedly out of the chamber.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND (in a voice scarcely audible). Follow him! He is desperate. The
      gold must be taken care of for his use; 'tis the dreadful acknowlegment of
      my debt to him. Louisa! I come! Farewell! On this altar let me breathe my
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (recovering from his stupor). Ferdinand! my son! Not one last
      look for a despairing father? (FERDINAND is laid by the side of LOUISA.)
    </p>
    <p>
      FERDINAND. My last must sue to God for mercy on myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (falling down before him in the most dreadful agony). The
      Creator and the created abandon me! Not one last look to cheer me in the
      hour of death! (FERDINAND stretches out his trembling hand to him, and
      expires.)
    </p>
    <p>
      PRESIDENT (springing up). He forgave me! (To the OFFICERS.) Now, lead on,
      sirs! I am your prisoner.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
